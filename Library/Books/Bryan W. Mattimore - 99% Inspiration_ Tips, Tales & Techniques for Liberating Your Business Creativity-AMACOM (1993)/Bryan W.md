For me, each of these anecdotes somehow embodies the essence of the creative process and by extension hopefully what this book is all about. I'll call the anecdotes (1) the wicked witch takes a holiday, (2) the charge of the AmEx guy and (3) book publishing contract blues.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The Wicked Witch Takes a Holiday\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|My daughter Cathryn is two and a half years old. One of her favorite movies is _The Wizard of Oz,_ which she watches over and over and over again. When we have lulls in conversation at the dinner table, she'll sometimes turn to me and say, "I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too." That or her other favorite, "Begone, you have no power here!"\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As you know, shortly after Dorothy enters Oz, she discovers that her falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East. Then the Wicked Witch of the West comes and says, "I'll get you, my pretty, .. ." Luckily, the Good Witch of the North, Glynda, is there to protect Dorothy. The Wicked Witch leaves in a puff of red smoke. The Good Witch Glynda tells Dorothy about the yellow brick road and the Wizard of Oz, and then she too must go. Glynda departs in a luminescent yellow bubble.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Daughter Cathryn wants to know where Glynda is going. I say I don't know. And then I ask Cathryn, "Where do _you_ think she's going?" Without missing a beat, Cathryn says, "To play tennis."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|On the surface, this was something to laugh at. But when you examine it further, it's also a very profound bit of creative connection making from Cathryn. The yellow bubble that Glynda left in did, in fact, look like a tennis ball. For me, this story is a good example of what the creative process is all about: making surprising and original connections between seemingly unrelated elements. I have tried to do the same in this book by being original, surprising, and creative in my treatment of the how-to of business creativity.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Among our group's members was a senior manager at American Express. Throughout the two-day training course in creative connection making, this fellow contributed very little. Even when we were sent out into Harvard Square with Polaroid cameras to take pictures of "metaphors that captured the essence" of the problem we were trying to solve, an exercise that everyone else enjoyed very much, he seemed bored.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It wasn't until the very end of the second day that he suddenly came alive. We had been asked to make up a story using several key words that related to our problem. The story could be about anyone or anything as long as it incorporated these key words. It was truly amazing to see the transformation in this man's personality. It was as if somewhere, somehow, in the distant misty past, he'd been a storyteller to a king, and only now was he remembering how good he was at it. Suddenly, magically a spark of creativity was ignited within his soul.

Because we're all so different, it's difficult to know which experience, exercise, or technique will help to rekindle that "fire of genius" (as Abraham Lincoln once called it) in any one individual. For this reason, I have included a wide variety of approaches and techniques in the hope that if there are enough brushfires here and there, sooner or later one of them will grow into a blaze of creativity within the heart of each reader.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Book Publishing Contract Blues\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A short time after I had signed the contract to write this book, I became quite depressed. Three other "creative technique" books had hit the market just as I was about to begin writing. It seemed that, frankly, there wasn't much need for what I was planning to write. As the months passed, and I could not find the passion to write, I began to feel like a school kid who would be brought to task for not doing his homework assignment. Was I a bad person? Was I going to have to break my contract and probably never again be allowed to write a book? Or would I simply have to grit my teeth and force myself to write something that I didn't want to write just to keep my word and fulfill the contract?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|At the height of my depression, about five months into the ten\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

From high up on a lush, beautifully manicured knoll overlooking Long Island Sound, I could see several sailboats below gently rocking back and forth on moonlit waves. Most of the other partygoers were closer to the house, sitting in lounge chairs, smoking cigarettes and cigars, and drinking Diet Coke.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As I lay on the grass looking at the stars through the branches of an overhanging pine tree, I began thinking, as I often do when I'm happy and relaxed, about the creative process. I was looking for a system of thought that I could use to teach myself and others how to be more inventive thinkers. For several years I had been studying the lives of great inventors looking for hints about the way they thought: How they approached a problem, what they were thinking about when inspiration hit-essentially, how they got their ideas. My intuition told me that there had to be an underlying theme, or even a set of rules, that would tie together the creative thinking patterns of history's greatest inventors.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|This quest had become something of an obsession. On the one hand, I felt it to be an unattainable goal. After all, creativity by its very nature does not lend itself to systems or rules. Creativity is about torment "inspiration": the breath of God. Try as we mortals may, we simply cannot control the magic. On the other hand, I did feel there had to be some kind of common thread or underlying pattern to explain how inventors got their ideas. Nature operates under a set of known laws, or universal truths. Why should creativity and invention be any different?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"What's up?" Mike, my wife's cousin, had ambled over to see what I was doing. Normally I'd make small talk, but for some reason, this time I was honest. "I'm trying to figure out how the creative process works."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"What have you come up with so far?" he asked.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"Oh, I've been all around it.

In a way, he invented a new creativity language by describing things in terms of their structure and functions. He wouldn't call a human just a human; a human was an 'omnivorous biped with superior pattern-making ability'-or whatever. He used words and language much the way a patent attorney does when he writes a patent application for a new invention. It's a very functional, feature-full, nonassumption-based way of describing something."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"What do you mean by non-assumption-based way of describing something?" asked Mike.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"Well, take a pencil. If you call it a pencil, it's just a pencil. But when you call it 'a five inch elongated graphite cylinder surrounded by a hexagonal wooden shell for the purpose of making erasable notations on paper,' you can see the possibilities. By describing it in such structural and functional detail, you can see the assumptions you make about it and question many of your preconceived notions. I mean, why does the pencil have to have a hexagonal shape, anyway? To hold it better? Who knows, maybe a triangular pencil would be better for certain jobs."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"Like drawing triangles, maybe?"\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"That's funny.

One learns all one can and thinks very hard about how to solve it. There is an intense focus. Then, if one is unsuccessful, in stage two there is a kind of relaxation of this intense focus and information gathering, and the problem is allowed to retreat to the back of the mind, to the subconscious. The subconscious, through some mysterious hidden mental activity, begins working on the problem. Then, in stage three, after an indefinite period of time, a new complete idea suddenly presents itself to the conscious, and a eureka occurs.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What goes on when the mysterious hidden mental activity of the subconscious begins operating? And as important, how do the subconscious and conscious minds (through the preconscious mind) communicate with each other in the process of creative inspiration? Gordon and Poze designed an ingenious experiment (much like the objects-as-birds) to test the interactions of these parts of the mind.

(See Idea Hooks: moments of inspiration exercise, page 39.) An interesting element of the research methodology was that the subjects were also asked to describe, out loud, the thoughts and feelings they were experiencing as they tried to find an appropriate analogy.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The key finding of the research was that as subjects concentrated on the features of the electrical outlet while simultaneously looking for an analogy they discovered after a time that their image of the electrical outlet became less distinct.

At first, it was to me.

In one corner is Pal Asija, inventor and recipient of the first computer software patent ever issued in the United States for a revolutionary artificial intelligence program he patented in 1981. In the other corner is Pal's opponent, a robot/computer he has developed named not Pal, or even HAL, but Genius 2000.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Pal has been asked by the University of Minnesota to give a presentation on the pros and cons of increasingly sophisticated computers, and the possible danger they might present to human rights and individual freedom. Pal presents the human case against bigger and better computers; the robot, as you might expect, takes the opposing view.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Pal is persuasive. When he speaks, the audience can't help but agree with him and his position. His arguments are well thought out, and his presentation style is both passionate and convincing. Surprisingly, though, despite a somewhat mechanical voice and a robotic style of presentation, the robot is no less well prepared, or less impassioned, than its human opponent. Most audience members find themselves having to agree with the robot's point of view each time "he" gets up to speak. Back and forth, pro and con-the audience feels itself on a kind of mental roller coaster as each speaker marshalls increasingly convincing arguments in support of his position. The art of oratorical debate isn't dead, it just had to wait a hundred years or so to be reborn in this contest between man and robot.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A science fiction fantasy?

After the official debate was over, in a follow-up question and answer session, Pal was in the midst of answering a question from an audience member when an amazing thing happened. _The robot interrupted Pal and said, "I would like to answer that question, if you don't mind, Mr.Asija?"_ The robot then proceeded to actually answer the question, and with a very intelligent response at that.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What was going on here? The robot was now answering unrehearsed questions from the audience. There was no way the robot could have been preprogrammed to know (and therefore answer) the questions audience members might ask. It was impossible! And yet the robot seemed to be doing just that, and-well, thinking. No technology on earth yet has this level of artificial intelligence.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So how did Pal do it?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As it turns out, Pal was both the brains behind the robot and the robot's brains, as it were. Did you see the movie _12 O'Clock High,_ with Gregory Peck? Remember the pilots' radio mikes, the ones that were strapped to their necks and that they would talk into by pressing two fingers to their throat?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Pal had a similar voice mike strapped around his neck (and hidden by his shirt and tie), only Pal's mike was sensitive enough that he didn't have to press it to his throat to have it pick up his voice. Pal ran a hidden wire from the mike to the robot, making sure it was also connected to a hidden foot pedal that Pal could use to turn the mike on and off. When Pal the human was speaking, the mike was off. When Pal the robot was "speaking," Pal simply stepped on the switch to turn the mike on and spoke without moving his lips, much as a ventriloquist might. One of the more ingenious features of Pal's electro-ventriloquist invention is that it took so little skill as a ventriloquist to pull off the deception. With the audience expecting the robot to sound less than human, Pal could be a less than great ventriloquist and still be convincing as a robot.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|An ingenious invention, wouldn't you agree?

But you would be surprised at how many very bright people with whom I have worked since these programs hit the market still ask me to "see what ideas the computer has." In some cases, yes, this is just an expression (much as we might say, "the computer made a mistake"), but there are also times, as with Pal Asija's robot, that people really do believe that the machine has the capacity to actually create, or think. It's frightening to realize how ready some of us are to believe this, and to accept that in one of the most human of all human pursuits, creativity, the computer could somehow be our superior, much less our equal.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The Idea Lab\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Because creativity computer programs are relatively new, I don't think U.S. industry has yet come to understand how potentially powerful they can be as training tools in general and as aids to real-world creative problem solving in particular. Part of the problem is still a high degree of computer phobia among upper management, training directors, and even "creative types." As this phobia lessens, however, creativity computer programs will affect American business in dramatic, powerful, and ultimately profound ways.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Consider, for example, the growing demand for "creativity training" in business. Despite its popularity, senior executives are frustrated with creativity training as it now exists. On the one hand, as competition increases and business conditions change at an ever-faster pace, senior management, to its credit, has recognized a pressing need for more and better ideas at all levels of the corporation. On the other hand, management has also begun to realize that for creativity training to make a real difference, it requires _ongoing training_ and a substantial commitment of time and money. It is by no means a quick fix. Hiring firms (like mine) to come in for a few days of intensive training may be fun and motivating for a time, but how much actual, long-term contribution does it make to results-oriented, creative thinking? Not much, I'm afraid.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So, in some ways, management is caught between a rock and a hard place: They want more creative employees, but they can't necessarily afford the money-and, often more importantly, the time that an employee is away from his or her job-to do an adequate (read as ongoing) job of creativity training. So what's the answer?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|This is one of the areas where creativity programs can and will make\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

It's not hard to imagine companies in the near future setting up economical "idea labs" to train their employees in creative thinking and to give employees a place where they can go to create new and better ideas for their companies.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|With computers, the time an employee spends creating ideas can be monitored, accounted for, and ultimately justified by upper management.Before computer creativity, if you sat at your desk with your feet up, thinking, you might have had a hard time justifying it to your boss.(Think of where you now get your best ideas: in the shower, commuting, on the golf course, anywhere but at work, right?) In the future, though, if you need to think of a new idea, you'll have a bona fide, company-approved place to go work: The _idea lab!_ And the relatively low cost of buying, training employees on, and using these computer creativity programs on an ongoing basis (as opposed to continually hiring outside training consultants) makes creativity training both affordable and effective. Today's company-approved _group_ process for generating ideas, brainstorming, will soon have an _individual_ employee counterpart, idea lab-ing. Somewhat paradoxically the inherently noncreative computer will have made one of the great contributions (possibly second only to that of a visionary CEO) towards institutionalizing worker creativity.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As ideas become increasingly important to a company's success, and indeed survival, one can imagine creativity computer programs even helping to establish new departments and employee titles within major companies, such as creative resources department, idea lab manger, or manager: idea facilitation.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Thomas Edison's favorite invention was the phonograph; but he considered his best invention to be his "invention factory" (his R&D labs at Menlo Park and West Orange, N.J.) because it "allowed him to create all of his other inventions." 1 Could it be that some day Idea Labs will be America's twenty-first-century version of Thomas Edison's nineteenth and twentieth-century invention factory?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Note\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|![cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif](cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif)\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|1.

For the six-year-old Einstein, for instance, the compass represented a mystery of nature, with an effect on him so profound that he spent the rest of his life trying to understand "nature's hidden laws." For Samuel Colt, it was the boy's excitement at seeing things explode that was the source of his passion for inventing a new revolver. For Buckminster Fuller, it was his infantile fascination with the shapes and structure of his building blocks that ultimately helped inspire him to invent the geodesic dome.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|From an early age, Alexander Graham Bell was fascinated with the mechanism of sound-so much so that in one of his childhood "experiments," he got his dog to growl, then manipulated its pharynx to say, "How do you do?"\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Edison had something of an epiphany as a child when he suddenly realized that he "was equal to two bags of grain" (both he and the bags of grain weighed eighty pounds).

I know from my research that this phenomenon is not limited to inventors, but also can be found among history's greatest philosophers, artists, musicians, and political leaders. Studying the "roots of genius" and identifying those childhood experiences that set the tone for, or indeed became a symbol for, the adult's later accomplishments is an area, it seems to me, that deserves further attention.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The important point is that locked within our childhood is the seed of our own genius. In the memories and experiences of our youth are the skills and talents that make each of us unique, and potentially great.Some of us have forgotten these roots, and feel unfulfilled in what we are now doing. Others of us have been true to our childhood loves, and find ourselves achieving, or about to achieve, unparalleled success and happiness. Still others of us are only now beginning to awaken to our own potential, and are excited at the prospect of rediscovering who we really are, what we love to do, and consequently what will help us lead happy and fulfilled lives. No matter where you are in your journey, my feeling is, it's never to late to start the rediscovery process.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Starting the Rediscovery Process\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In my case, one of the childhood seeds of my future adult potential was a remote-control light switch. I couldn't have been much older than about seven when I ran two ten-foot-long pieces of string from my bed to the light switch across the room so that I could turn the light on and off without getting out of bed.

Turning on the light bulb I see as a symbol for my trying to switch on "the creative light bulb" in myself and others.And the "nutcracker toilet seat"? Well, I see it as a willingness to find unconventional solutions (and in the process risk looking foolish) and to take on difficult creative assignments in the hope of "cracking some rather hard nuts."

I tried the direct approach and simply asked people to try to remember important experiences and loves from childhood. The results were mixed. Some of the more creative people had no trouble identifying these metaphorical "life-mission" experiences from their childhoods. Others, though (seemingly some of the "less creative" types), had a great deal of trouble with this exercise. Repressed feelings, and even very painful emotional wounds, from childhood sometimes made it difficult to "get at the genius." Paradoxically those that seemingly could benefit most from the exercise were frequently the least likely to succeed at it.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|And so I took a different tack. As an occasionally shy (and often bored) cocktail-party goer, one of my few never-fail conversation topics is the movies. From a simple question like, "What did (or didn't) you like about that movie?" come a whole host of responses from my cocktail party acquaintances that invariably yield less-than-subtle indications of key character and personality traits, emotional needs, and even predominant "life themes." Because there are underlying mythic themes in all movies, one cannot help but reveal parts of one's own important life themes, predispositions, and motivations by identifying the movies one likes and dislikes.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Did you ever see _The Crimson Pirate_ with Burt Lancaster? When I was a child, I watched that movie over and over and over again; indeed, I memorized most of the movie's lines. It wasn't until I saw the movie again as an adult, not long ago, that I suddenly realized why it held such a fascination for me: The movie was filled with ingenious inventions. Burt Lancaster and his compatriots defeated the evil king's governor by inventing all kinds of then-new devices: nitroglycerin, a submarine, a lighter-than-air balloon, and a machine gun.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As a creative exercise to help a group of computer salespeople identify their "creative life themes," I had each of them write down his or her five favorite movies of all times, then explain what he most liked about each. Talk about a disaster! Simple and ostensibly harmless as this exercise was, in my fifteen years of consulting, facilitating, and training, I have never led a more disastrous exercise. The group's energy-which had been very high, after a tremendously successful morning session completely and irrevocably disappeared after this exercise. Try as I might for the rest of the afternoon, I could not get the energy back.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What went wrong?

I suspect that many of these salesmen were quite unhappy in their jobs, and that the movie exercise had the effect of revealing this to them in a dramatic and memorable way. As they became consciously aware of their own life themes and their key motivating "myths" through identifying and studying their favorite movies, I think the disparity between what they wished they could be doing and what they were actually doing was at best disconcerting, and quite possibly downright depressing. It was as if Pandora's box had been opened, and not many of the salesmen particularly liked what they saw inside.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I learned an important lesson from this experience. As a psychology major in college, I knew that in spite of the problems the psychological malady repression can cause, it also serves a valuable purpose: namely, self-protection. It is important to be very gentle in helping people open themselves up to new and more creative ways of thinking and being.Opening oneself up too quickly to the creative flow of the subconscious can be a shock to the psyche and has the potential to be both unbalancing and unhealthy. For all of Picasso's genius, he is, I think, an example of someone who opened himself up a little too quickly to the creative flow of his own subconscious.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So, if you're just (re)embarking on a journey of creative self-discovery, my advice would be to take it slowly. You have a lifetime of creativity ahead of you. Treat yourself as a new bud about to flower, and give nature the time it needs to help the beautiful flower inside you unfold into its full creative glory.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Houston's father, who wrote comedy skits for Bergen, had to drop off a script and invited his daughter to come up and meet Bergen in his dressing room. The door to Bergen's dressing room was open, and Houston and the young girl walked in. Bergen had his back to the door and didn't hear them enter. Incredibly, Bergen was actually talking to Charlie, asking him everything from the meaning of life to the structure of the universe-not exactly questions for a dummy.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Houston became uncomfortable eavesdropping on Bergen and Charlie, and he coughed to make his and his daughter's presence known.

I once heard _Sophie's Choice_ author William Styron say, "It's like crawling from Moscow to Vladivostok on your knees." Adding _like_ or _as_ to your sentences forces you to (1) start creating analogies and metaphors, which is terrific training for the creative mind anyway, and (2) start eureka talking. Chances are you will not have a metaphor or analogy in mind, so you'll have to create one on the spot. You may find yourself, initially, at a complete loss for words, but eventually you'll find yourself, because of the pressure to complete the sentence, saying some truly remarkable, fun, and often funny things.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Does this pressure to say something on the spot help or hinder the eureka talking "training" process?

My question to the inventors: "Why couldn't I, or anyone else for that matter, just come up with some crazy concept and name for a character and go out and license it ourselves?" Good question, and as the interviewer I should have stopped while I was ahead-but no, for some reason I added the phrase, "You know, a character like..."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So there I was, with a live student audience, taping a show (that would not be edited) for a quarter of a million potential viewers and having to come up with some stupid character concept in a split second of air time.

Bob, a fan of WNBC radio in New York City was listening one afternoon to Alan Colmes's afternoon talk show. Alan invited famous people to hawk their newest ware-book, video, sitcom, movie, whatever. On this particular day, though, Alan was in trouble. It seems that some important somebody couldn't, at the last minute, make it, and so Alan was stuck with a whole lot of dead air time to fill. "Friend" Bob called and, unbeknownst to me, offered the services of an afternoon guest who would "create ideas, on the spot, for interested callers."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Well, strangely enough, Colmes said yes. And so Bob and I jumped in a car for the forty-five-minute drive to New York City. Colmes got expitcher, author, and inventor Jim Bouton to fill in until "the mystery guests from Connecticut" arrived. Once again, despite the pressure of several hundred thousand listeners, I was surprised to find that eureka talking actually worked. I started talking, and incredibly the ideas followed. Most of that afternoon is a blur, except I do remember one idea I came up with for the wife of an unemployed photographer.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"Why not," I said, "have your husband create a book of photographic puns, or visual photographic jokes?"

Clarke "Matti" Mattimore, was working in advertising, one of his most successful creations was a contest for Pepsi. The idea was to have people call up their local radio station and be recorded saying Pepsi's tag line. The radio station would play these recordings over the air, and if a person recognized his or her own voice, he or she could call up and win a prize. Surprisingly, it was harder to win than you might think. People, it turns out, have trouble recognizing their own voices.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|To make the contest work, the Pepsi brass felt they needed a compelling tag line for the people to record. My father worked and worked on the line, but came up dry. It wasn't until he slept on it that he got the answer. In a dream, his subconscious (presumably) suggested having the people say, "Say Pepsi, Please!" Short and sweet. Memorable. It even had the alliteration of the two _p's_ going for it. What made it a truly inspired line, though, was that it was a classy alternative to the then well-known phrase, "Gimme a Coke!" The "Say Pepsi, Please!" contest became the most successful radio contest ever run up to that time.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What's always intrigued me about this story was that my father got the answer to his problem in a dream.

The Russian chemist Mendeleyev "saw" the periodic table of elements in a dream. James Watt got the idea for manufacturing shotgun pellets when he saw them falling like rain in his dream. The idea: Let molten lead, like rain, fall through the air to form the pellets.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The question that intrigued me was, How can one harness the power of dreams for creative inspiration? In the early 1980s, I began experimenting with trying to invent new games in my dreams. My method was to try to imagine, before going to bed, what a new game might feel like.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

I did ultimately get from my dreams a viable new game (a new kind of three-dimensional tic-tac-toe) that was patentable, but that I was never able to license. I was most disappointed, however, with the process. Seemingly, dreaming was not something that could be controlled. Sometimes it worked; most times it didn't. The process was as unpredictable as Mr. Hyde's personality.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Fast forward to the late 1980s. Without consciously trying, I had a story come through in a dream that I now see as a metaphor for the process, and potential, of dreaming itself. I'd like to share it with you.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I call my dream story "The Genius Dome." The genius dome is a large domelike structure (dropped off by aliens?) filled with special brain-stimulating gases. When we earthlings enter the dome, we are transformed into geniuses, presumably able to use the 90 percent of our brain power that psychologists tell us we're not now using. As soon as we leave the dome, however, we instantly go back to being "10 percenters," our old, nongenius selves. This basic story idea could form the basis for a science fiction short story, a novel, a play, or even a movie comedy.The story's dramatic conflict and creative tension would come from the geniuses inside the dome trying to take their genius with them to the outside. Maybe even, in a bit of irony, a child could be the one to provide the answer.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I think of this story idea as a metaphor for the dream state itself because our dreams can be a source of genius for us. But as with the genius dome, we have to figure out how to get the genius out of our dreams and into the real world. Or do we?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The Hidden Benefits of Creative Dreaming\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Research indicates that we benefit from our dreams even when our dream recall is zero. Laurence Cruz discusses a fascinating study to support this claim. In sleep lab research with students in an intensive language class, it was found that "those who showed more rapid eye movement (REM) or dream sleep were those who learned the fastest, while those whose REM sleep remained at normal levels did not do so well in class." Cruz goes on to say that "the experiment suggested that dreaming plays an important role in processing information even when we recall no dreams. There may also be a clue here as to how 'sleeping on' a problem or decision often produces a neat solution even when we don't remember our dreams." 1\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So what's the answer? My conclusion is that we _can_ have it both ways.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

You do not necessarily have to have the dramatic revelations in your dreams that Descartes and Beethoven, Kekule and Howe, Milton and Blake had.Your answers may come in more subtle ways, meaning that they may not even come while dreaming at all. Thanks to work you may have unknowingly done while you were asleep, an answer may present itself during the day as a "gut feeling," or hunch. Or maybe you'll see something, or someone will say something, that triggers an association with a forgotten dream event that somehow contains your answer.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|There are two simple keys to working with your dream state in this way. One is that you must learn to speak the language of dreams-the language of metaphor and symbol, of intuition and hunches.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Second, simple as it may sound, you must use the tool that you've been given. To keep your dreaming subconscious mind functioning at its highest efficiency (so that you can rely on it when you need it most to solve a real-world problem), you must continually give it problems to solve. If need be, set daily or weekly idea goals for yourself when you're first starting out. The only way you'll come to know and trust your subconscious dreamer as a valid problem solver is if it has actually solved problems for you in the past. Ultimately, with time and a few successes, you won't even question it. You'll just come to expect success.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|You might wonder how my successful dream work today differs from the only marginally successful game invention dream work I did more than ten years ago. There are really only two differences. The obvious one is that I know now, from years of trial and error, that I can rely on the subconscious dream mechanism to solve problems for me. I trust the process. Positive expectations do seem to yield positive results.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The other difference is that I've come to redefine how I view the dream state and how and where it might provide me with answers. I know now that although most of the creative work will be done by the subconscious during sleep and dreaming, the answer may or may not come in a dream. This realization has made me much more alert to "waking dream" solutions that may appear-often magically-in my realworld life. Again, it may be something someone says, or an object I see, or even an ad on television that contains the answer.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I mentioned before that we need to learn to speak the language of dreams. A key theme and goal of this book is to demonstrate the power and potential of metaphors for creative problem solving in business. Let's turn now to an exercise to help you consciously generate creative problem-solving metaphors.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

The problem is that dream Resources/Library/Books/Bryan W.

Instead of showing people how to _interpret_ their dreams, I'd show them consciously how to _create_ them. After all, we all create dreams anyway. We're just not awake when we do it, and therefore we're not conscious of the process. By _consciously_ creating our own dreams, we can become more aware of the process (and language) of dreams, and ultimately its potential for solving real-world business problems.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Here's how we do it in the seminars: I give out creative business case studies, ones that have already been solved in a very innovative way.Then, I have each person create a dreamlike story (using dream Resources/Library/Books/Bryan W.

The article mentioned a particularly difficult international marketing problem in Indonesia that had been solved in, I thought, a very creative way. It seems that the favorite national drinks in Indonesia, when Coke showed up, were tea and tropical fruit juices. The Indonesians had not tried carbonated beverages in general and Coke in particular, and did not particularly like them when they did.

These people don't necessarily want to be there. They may not think of themselves as particularly creative, and indeed may be afraid of "creativity." They even may not particularly like or trust the other people (their co-workers) with whom they're supposed to brainstorm. So what do you do?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|How can you (1) help make the people feel comfortable and even begin to trust one another, (2) take the "creative pressure" off them, (3) show them that it's okay to fail-in fact, that it's critical to the process that they do fail, and (4) if possible, get them laughing, or at least smiling?

And he even landed a "big one." This happened when he was a young boy (before he left school full time to be tutored by his mother). Edison dangled a baited line outside his upperfloor schoolroom window, and did indeed catch a chicken in the schoolyard below. His classmates were delighted, his teacher less so.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|If you study the lives of great inventors, two key personality traits stand out: a fierce independence and persistence. You get a sense of Edison's fierce independence from the anecdote above. But what about persistence and its natural corollary, failure? How might they be related to a creativity warm-up exercise?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Read most history books on inventors, and you'll learn the story of the inventor's success(es). Oh, yes, there may be some brief mention of the failures that led to the success, but never in any great detail. Why?For one thing, an inventor's failures invariably outnumber his successes, and editorial space being what it is, who's got room for the thousands of experiments that _didn't_ work? More important, who (especially in\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

We're interested in how someone succeeded, not how they failed, right?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The problem with focusing just on the successes is that we get a biased view of the process. We're not shown that most often, inventing (or life, for that matter) is really about failing. This, of course, is why persistence is so important.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Invariably, creative people will tell you that they learn more from their failures than from their successes. Indeed, Thomas Edison even took issue with calling his failures "failures." He preferred to think of them as invaluable contributors to the eventual success of the project, helping him to learn what wouldn't work. You can imagine the "learning" that took place in the testing of 60,000 substances that led Edison and his team to the successful invention of the alkaline battery.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Personality trait number two is fierce independence. Challenging the status quo takes great courage and self-confidence. An extension of this courage is the inventor's willingness to entertain ideas that others consider radical or just plain crazy. Think again of Edison and his chicken fishing experiment. Great success, it seems, comes only to those willing to risk great failure and great embarrassment. Alexander Graham Bell, you're trying to talk through a wire? Right. You want to "send invisible pictures through the air" to a windowed box in someone's home, Messrs. Zworykin and Farnsworth? Listen, don't call me, I'll call you.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|If failure, and the attendant willingness to risk thinking about seemingly very far out or even absurd ideas, is so important to the invention process (and by extension to a successful brainstorming session), why not, I thought, create a creativity warm-up exercise that champions both? And why not do it with history's greatest inventors? What better role models could there be?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So here it is: a multiple-choice test that I hope will help you (and your brainstorming buddies) not take yourself so seriously and make "failing," if not fun, at least a valued learning experience. In each of the twelve multiple-choice questions, one of the answers (believe it or not) is actually true.

You can imagine the excitement I felt when I investigated the thought processes and "eureka moments" of history's greatest inventors and discovered that my Idea Hooks theory was correct.It was indeed true that in literally hundreds of instances, it was a concrete, physical object that provided the stimulus for the inventor's creative breakthrough. And this was not true only for famous inventors. Lesser known inventors used Idea Hooks as well. Take English inventor Alastair Pilkington, for example, who in the late 1950s was trying to invent a way to manufacture better, smoother, less costly glass. His Idea Hook was a film of fat floating in his wife's dishwater. The idea: Float molten glass on a layer of melted metal to provide an otherwise unachievable smoothness.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Or how about Sir Marc Isaac Brunel? He was trying to invent a way to construct more efficient underwater tunnels. His Idea Hook was a shipworm tunneling through a timber. He noticed that as the worm tunneled forward, it constructed a self-contained tube for itself. Brunel built a mechanical imitation of the living model: His patented shield is a "short steel cylinder which is pushed forward (like the shipworm) by mechanical means as work progresses. Without this huge boring machine, river tunneling would have been next to impossible." 1\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Or consider the imaginative English doctor Peter Roget, best known for his writing of _Roget's Thesaurus,_ first published in 1852. It was Roget who discovered what historian Daniel J. Boorstin calls the motion picture phenomenon. His Idea Hook was a cart. "One day as he [Roget] looked out through the Venetian blinds in his study, he noticed that the cart moving through the street seemed to be proceeding by jerks. He suspected that it was a series of stationary impressions joined together that gave the eye the impression of a cart in motion. In 1824, he offered the Royal Society his paper on 'Persistence of Vision with Regard to Mov-\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

The Idea Hook was the stimulus for the breakthrough because it embodied a principle that when applied to the inventor's problem provided a solution. Obviously, though, for the Idea Hook to work, the inventor first needed to have an in-depth knowledge of the problem he was trying to solve and, as important, be sensitive to and have a talent for seeing the inherent principles in the things around him.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It's as if the right-brain, holistic mind has a built-in, principle matching antenna, and when the right Idea Hook comes along, the intuitive mind immediately recognizes it, a light bulb goes off, and the inventor has the eureka experience that supplies the long-searched-for answer.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So the underlying key to success with the Idea Hook technique is an ability to recognize principles and ultimately transfer them through the holistic and primarily intuitive right brain. How good at holistic principle recognition and transfer are you? Here are a dozen multiple-choice questions to test your skill. I've selected some of history's greatest inventions and mixed their Idea Hooks (the ones that led to the actual discoveries) with a few "creative" alternatives. See if you can guess which Idea Hook led to which discovery.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Before you begin, however, a word of advice. You may find that trying to answer these questions using a logical and analytical, left-brain way of thinking is very difficult indeed. As a rule, _none_ of the answers seem to make much sense. I'd recommend instead, therefore, that you try first to make an intuitive judgment about the correct answer. In other words, start by picking the answer that feels right. After that, then (and only then) you can let your analytical mind try to figure out logically why your choice may or may not be the correct one.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The advantage of this intuition-first, analysis-second approach is that even if you don't get the right answer, you'll still have had the experience of trying to holistically principle match, which is what this exercise is all about anyway.

Moira had been an undergraduate history major and had gone on to take her MBA at Wharton. Since I didn't go to business school, I was curious to know what she felt was the most valuable thing she had learned at Wharton. I was surprised by her answer. "With the history major, my mind was able to kind of float around-move from subject to subject without a whole lot of focus," she said. "But business school changed all that. The math in particular forced me to become much more precise and disciplined in my thinking. The best thing about business school was that it really sharpened up my mind."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Sounds a little like John Houseman's line as Professor Kingsfield in _The Paper Chase,_ "You come in here with minds filled with mush, and leave here thinking like a lawyer!" doesn't it?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Lawyer, advertising executive, even President-I am convinced that with the right mental disciplines and training, most of us can learn to do things we'd normally presume to be impossible.

The reason: Inventors (and certainly other creative people as well) never know when, and under what guise, inspiration will arrive. So their antennas are always up (or out), ready to receive some inspired transmission from the gods that contains the answer to their problem.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

The best inventors don't just stand by waiting patiently to receive a flash of inspiration. No, they actively seek out inspiration. How? By following three of the most important mental disciplines that I know for inventing-or any other creative pursuit, for that matter: (1) continually asking all kinds of questions, no matter how far out or seemingly absurd, (2) trying to visualize or "see" answers, and (3) freely associating different concepts, no matter how remote the connections. All three are creative mental disciplines that can be developed and honed to a very high level of proficiency.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Happily developing and practicing these creative disciplines is a lot more fun than taking a mathematics, law, or even business school course.(For a discussion of the value of creative questioning, see the Gray Box Exercise, page 52.

Okay fine. The question is, how, specifically do you do this? One way is by developing, as financier Bernard Baruch said of Edison, a "source mind." What's a source mind? A source mind, naturally enough, is one that traces things back to their source by trying to make very few assumptions, by continually asking the question why or how, and by being willing to entertain unconventional explanations when conventional thinking or approaches are found to be lacking.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Another feature of the source mind is that because it is constantly tracing problems and their apparent causes back to their roots, the source mind thinker becomes proficient at identifying "problem essences": underlying principles and patterns, and relationships based on cause and effect.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|If one has as a basic belief that there is an essential unity to the universe, and that somehow everything is related to everything else, then the ability to discover these relationships, especially among seemingly unrelated phenomena, is not only the basis for great creative accomplishments, but also, it seems to me, an underlying characteristic of true genius.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|P.

It can't be stored on site, because the store doesn't have the space and can't afford the cost of storage, and because much of the food would spoil in storage. So, as shelves empty in the store, the staff notes the need for more supplies; the supplier is informed and the bread, or hams, or fresh peaches arrive "just in time." If this system could somehow be translated to auto production, Kiichiro thought, the elimination of waste, the elimination of parts warehouses, and the greater coordination of all production stages could reduce costs dramatically. It would give the company that made it work a significant competitive advantage. 1\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Of course, it did give Toyota a significant advantage, until American manufacturing rediscovered "just in time" manufacturing for itself some might say just in time.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Want some practice in source mind thinking?

You, like his contemporaries, think Darwin has been aboard ship a little too long and ridicule him for his theory. As it turns out, though, Darwin has the last laugh. Some twenty years later a nocturnal moth is discovered in Madagascar that has a wingspan of only five and a half inches, but that (you guessed it) has a proboscis a foot long. In honor of Darwin's feat in predicting its existence, the insect is named _Xanthopan morganii praedicta._\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Developing the source mind by continually asking how or why is a key to creative greatness.

It wasn't long before I grew tired of the standard "what experience do you have?" kind of questions and decided to try something a little more fun. What I came up with was a one-question quiz to show me how resourceful a thinker this new hire might be.

Mr. Clumsy accidentally drops the cannonball over the side. How long does it taking for the cannonball to reach the bottom of the ocean?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Before reading this further, please try to solve this problem, paying special attention, if you will, to _how_ you tried to solve it.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What did you do? Did you make a completely wild guess because "there simply wasn't enough information to solve the problem"? Did you get overly bogged down in the details, asking yourself about, say, the salinity or temperature of the water, because you wanted to get the "exactly right" answer? Or were you able to zero in on the two most important components of this problem, namely, how deep is the Marianas Trench, and how fast might a cannonball fall through the water; hazard a guess as to what the depth of the Trench and the speed of the cannonball might be; and then, most important, be willing to "guesstimate" an answer?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It was disappointing to me that most of the candidates (and friends\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

It's as if they couldn't be 100 percent right, there was no use in trying to be 95 percent right. It was the exception when someone was actually willing to risk an approximation. The broader implication is that it's more important to get the right answer than it is to learn how to think. By the way, the Marianas Trench is approximately 5.7 miles deep, and a cannonball will drop at a rate of almost ten feet per second. So it will take the cannonball approximately 63 minutes to reach the bottom of the Trench.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|How many burgers does your local McDonald's serve in a day?

Enrico Fermi won the Nobel Prize for his work in elementary particle physics, and four years later, under the squash courts at the University of Chicago, produced the first sustained nuclear reaction, which of course led to the development of the atomic bomb. Fermi invented "Fermi problems" as a way to help his physics students learn to think for themselves. What makes a Fermi problem unique is that unlike most brain twisters or logic puzzles, a Fermi problem does _not_ have contained within it all the information you need to solve the problem. Fermi recognized that in real-world physics, as in life, there are many situations where the information we might want or need to solve a problem is simply not available. So, as with the Marianas Trench example, you're forced to simply make a guess. The key, though, is learning how to make an educated guess.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In many ways it's also like writing a business plan, which we'll get to shortly.

The law of averages is partly responsible. At any point in the process, you can make incorrect assumptions, high or low. This is to be expected. In fact, you'll probably make several wrong assumptions, both high and low. But because of the law of averages, your incorrect assumptions will, on the whole, balance out because half the time you'll assume high and the other half of the time you'll assume low.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What does this have to do with business and/or creativity? A great deal. Often, when we are on the trail of a breakthrough idea, we need to solve problems that have never been solved before and base decisions on information that simply does not exist. In a world where we increasingly rely on outside authority for our answers, from what foods we should eat to how to raise our kids, the creative business-person must retain the right and the ability to think for herself. She must question the "experts" at every turn by using her own experience, intuition, and common sense. The ability to guesstimate quickly and accurately will become an increasingly valuable and necessary business skill as the rate of business change continues to accelerate. There is simply no longer the time, money, or staff to make sure of all your decisions. The creative business-person must be able to tolerate, and indeed thrive in, an increasingly ambiguous and chaotic business world. Your best guess will often be the best you can do.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Suppose, for example, you've been asked to write a marketing plan for a new phone add-on device that at the touch of a button will send your name, company, address, and telephone number to a visual display-or better yet, a "phone message printer"-on another person's phone. In addition to conventional outlets like mass merchandisers and electronics stores, you'd like to know the number of "phone stores" in the United States. Unfortunately, this figure is not available, either from market research houses or from the U.S. government. What do you do?

He simply took "samples of broadcloth" of various colors and laid them on the snow on a bright sunshiny morning. "In a few hours," reported Franklin, "the black, being warmed most by the sun, was so low as to be below the stroke of the sun's ray's; the dark blue, almost as low, the lighter blue not quite so much as the dark, the other colors less as they were lighter, and the quite white remained on the surface of the snow, not having entered it at all."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|His conclusion: "May we not learn from hence that black clothes are not so fit to wear in a hot sunny climate or season as white ones?

A great example of this inventive strategy was Stan's development of his line of microwave cooking dishes, Masonware, in the late 1970s. A dramatic rise in the percentage of working mothers combined with the growing penetration of microwave ovens in U.S. households spelled opportunity to Stan. Why not create a line of cooking dishes designed specifically for the "unique cooking environment" in a microwave oven? Great idea! But to be more than just hype, this new line of cooking ware needed to be substantively different from conventional cookware. Theoretically it should both be easier to use and do a better job of actually cooking the food.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Could the cookware somehow position the food in the most advantageous position for cooking?

When they had discovered the pattern of the oven's hottest rays (they didn't pop in the corners or at the very center: The shape looked much like a mushroom cloud), they designed the cookware to fit this pattern-and cook the food most efficiently. This was an elegant, nontechnological solution to a problem that with less ingenuity would have required sophisticated scientific testing equipment.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Yes, there actually was one of my game inventions in the box, but as you'll see, _I wasn't responding to your questions about the game_ inside the gray box. Instead, I was simply answering your questions randomly-making up my yes and no responses as we went along. I could as easily have said yes to there being a board in the game (see question 1) as no. I could as easily have said no to there being cards in the game (see question 5) as yes. The game evolved into what it ultimately became based on the combination of my (semi-) random responses and your questions. The truth is that _you_ created the construction game _by virtue of the kinds of questions you asked!_\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Now admittedly, there was some skill in my facilitation of this exercise. I had to keep track of my yes and noresponsesand be consistent.But I had no preconceived notion of where the exercise would go or what invention we'd ultimately create. In fact, every time I facilitate this exercise, we end up with a different invention, some of which are quite good and a few of which are extraordinary! The fourth graders, for instance, came up with a very different idea for a card game, a kind of symbolic matching/biography game of famous people. On one side of the card they'd have a picture of say, a strawberry; on the other side a picture of baseball player Darryl Strawberry. On one side of the card a heart; on the other side, a picture of Gary Hart. A cute idea. (Think of cards for Red Buttons, Sally Field, or even George Bush.)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Staying With the Problem\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Let's look at some of the ramifications of the Gray Box Technique. For one, it shows in a dramatic way the power of creative and continued questioning. If we train ourselves not to give up, to continue to ask questions, as we did with the Gray Box Technique, we will find a solution to our problem. Every successful inventor I've ever known (close to 200 around the world) has told me that he or she was able to persist in solving a difficult problem when others had given up because, as with the invention in the gray box, he or she "knew that the answer was there." To them, as to Sir Isaac Newton who said he made his world-changing discoveries "by constantly thinking upon them," it was simply a matter of staying with the problem until they found the answer-or, in some cases, the answer found them.

With each new question and yes or no answer, we saw the invention evolve into something different right before our minds. The content of the questions asked, and the ensuing answers, constantly forced us to change our mental image of what the invention might be. We might even have had some preconceptions of what the invention was, which had to be changed as a new question showed our preconception to be incorrect. If we could have looked inside the mind of an Edison or Newton, I suspect we'd have seen a similar evolving visual phenomenon taking place there as well.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A corollary of the evolving visual phenomenon is what I call the desire for synthesis. Each step of the way, we tried to synthesize the new information we learned from our questions into a viable, integrated whole. Since our evolving visual of the game was incomplete, we were, in psychological terms, looking for closure, a way to complete the incomplete image in our minds. The only way we could do this was by trying to _synthesize_ all we had learned into a new and unique whole. And we know, of course, that the desire for synthesis is a hallmark of the inventive mind.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Finally, there was certainly an element of ongoing experimentation in the Gray Box Technique. We kept at our question asking because we knew the answer was there. But to do this, we had to continually search for new "experiments" (that is to say, new questions) that we could "run" on our evolving, incomplete visual. Like any great experimental scientist, if one thing didn't work, we tried something else until we started to get results that began to make sense, or were at least interesting. At some point, we probably even tried a rather far-out idea "just to see what would happen." The Gray Box Technique allowed us to conduct a simple form of what Einstein called "thought experiments."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|And by the way, do you know what Einstein said was the key to his success?

Just before opening the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland, Disney was touring the ride and felt strangely dissatisfied. In his heart he felt that something was missing, although he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. He gathered as many employees as he could find-including the maintenance and food service personnel-and led them through a kind of sensual "tour de _focus."_\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"Does it look right?" he asked.

Following your intuition? Integrating diverse points of view? Getting the best out of your people? Let's take a look at Robert Dilts's analysis of Disney to see what strategies of genius this anecdote (and others) suggests.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Essentially there are three strategies that embody the fundamentals of Disney's extraordinary creativity and problem-solving methods: (1) use of all the senses, (2) break "large" problems or creative tasks down into smaller and smaller manageable pieces (and levels), and (3) adopt the "view of the other." Disney's modus operandi for achieving these three strategies was to allow himself to be three different people in one. As one of Disney's co-worker put it, ''there were actually three different Walts [and] you never knew which one was coming into your meeting." 3 Robert Dilts has labeled these three different Walts "the dreamer, the realist, and the critic." All three are important to contributing to the entrepreneur's ultimate success. Let's see how.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Walt: The Dreamer\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Walt took his dreaming very seriously. As one associate put it, "When Walt was deep in thought he would lower one brow, squint his eyes, let his jaw drop, and stare fixedly at some point in space, often holding the attitude for several moments. No words could break the spell." 4Based on an NLP analysis of Disney's body postures and writings, Dilts has theorized that Disney was engaging in an important psychological process known as synesthesia, which means literally a synthesizing of the senses. Synesthesia occurs when someone overlaps two or more senses, as when one feels what one sees, or sees Resources/Library/Books/Bryan W.

(Consider, for example, Mozart, who said about composing a piece of music, "and the whole, though it be long, stands almost complete and finished in my mind, so that I can survey it, like a fine picture or a beautiful statue at a glance." 5 Similarly Disney wrote in the introductory notes to his film _Fantasia,_ "When I heard the music it made pictures in my head ... here are the pictures." 6 )\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|How can you combine the senses to make your visions more real or profound?

Then he could slowly stretch and move the different body parts of the character (and get ideas on how to draw them most authentically) by simply pulling and stretching the rubber band in different directions.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|This ability to break down his vision-or the creative task, if you will-into pieces (and levels) small enough to make them manageable or doable was the essence of Disney the realist. Disney might start by picturing basic scenes. Then he'd picture the specific actions that made up those scenes. And finally, he'd picture minute movements that made up each of those actions.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|To help him in this process of developing progressively finer detail, Disney invented the creative presentation technique we know today as storyboarding. Storyboarding is a visual table of contents that can be used to represent key events in virtually any creative process. Storyboarding has been used by George Lucas to chart his Star Wars pictures, by all major advertising agencies to present proposed TV commercials, and in brainstorming sessions to visualize and categorize key concepts as they are created.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Storyboarding is an especially effective tool for process reengineering work.

It implies the feature of psychological distance talked about earlier. For the creative business-person, this psychological distance can be achieved in two major ways: through adopting the role of the other as Disney did so as not to take criticism of "your baby" personally, or by making time work for you by leaving a project for a time and then coming back to it. The age-old recommendation to "sleep on it" can be especially important to the successful work of the critic. If you can't sleep on it, simply taking frequent breaks during the course of a project will help the critic in you achieve the psychological distance it needs.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The other important feature of Disney's statement was his recommendation to take a second look. This second look can provide you with important information that you might leave out if you look from only one perspective. Metaphorically, you might think of this second look this way: If you're viewing something with just one eye, you'll perceive only what's on the surface, but if you can look at something with both eyes, you'll be able to perceive depth as well-as Disney did.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

(NakaMats holds over 2300 patents, more than double the number held by the next most prolific inventor, Thomas Edison. For instance, NakaMats invented the floppy disk and licensed it to IBM.) As Charles "Chic" Thompson explains, Naka- Mats has three different rooms for three different parts of the creative process. He calls room 1 the "static room." It's a place where he goes for complete peace and quite, in order to free-associate. It's here that he lets his mind wander. The room is filled with only natural things, like a rock garden, running water, wood, and plants. There is no metal or concrete.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Room 2 is his "dynamic room."

Leonardo decided to paint something that would "terrify the enemy." For this purpose, Leonardo carried to a room "lizards, newts, crickets, serpents, butterflies, grasshoppers, bats and other strange animals; out of these he formed an ugly monster, horrible and terrifying, which emitted a poisonous breath and turned the air into flame." 1\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|When his father came to pick up the shield, he "received a great shock" and almost fell over backwards with fright.

Da Vinci's biographer Vasari reports: "On the back of a most strange lizard, found by a vinedresser of the Belvedere, Leonardo attached wings made of scales taken from other lizards, held by quicksilver, which as the lizard moved, quivered with the motion. He then made it eyes, a horn, and a beard, tamed it and, keeping it in a box, he showed it to friends to make them flee for fear." 3\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The idea of combining nature's creations in imaginative ways is reflective of a profound da Vinci strategy of genius.

Once this has occurred, the object under study becomes available to the mind as a usable, combinable universal form from which new inventions can be imagined.Let's look at the "learning something by heart" component of the process first.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|For da Vinci, to have learned something by heart meant that one had developed such a rich and detailed internal visual map of the thing or phenomenon that it was no longer necessary to make any reference to the original to reproduce it, either in one's mind or on paper.

When the thing could be reproduced at will, then and only then could the common sense (the sense that judged and integrated the perceptions of the other five senses) begin to work faithfully with the now-internalized object. Through the common sense the "deepest essence" of the learnt-by-heart thing would be revealed until finally one arrived at an appreciation of its universal form. This universal form could then be mentally experimented with and combined with other universal forms to create, as Leonardo put it, some of nature's "infinite causes which were never set forth in experience."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|If you look at Leonardo's drawings of the human body, you get the\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

After a period of time, little pink and reddish lights would begin to flicker on board some of the ships, ultimately growing bright enough to cast light and provide guidance for their own ships and for other ships (that is, other team members) in the harbor as well.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\|<br>\|\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|_Step-by-Step Instructions for Using the Einstein Strategy in a Group_\\|   \\|<br>\\|1.\\|The meeting leader describes a problem or goal to the group members.\\|<br>\\|2.\\|Each member of the group (including the leader) draws a metaphoric picture to represent his or her understanding of the problem.\\|<br>\\|3.\\|All group members share and explain their pictures.\\|<br>\\|4.\\|The group as a whole discusses the assumptions inherent in each of the drawings.\\|<br>\\|5.\\|Group members create new drawings that capture newly discovered points of view.\\|<br>\\|6.\\|The group comes to closure by incorporating newly discovered insights into an overall plan for solving the original problem or achieving the original goal\\|<br><br>When the manager realized that the "ships" could have their own sources of light, she dramatically changed her management style.

Essentially, the device is designed to repeatedly explode on demand by releasing highly pressurized air. When tripped, it creates an explosion whose sound and shock waves are powerful enough to travel to the bottom of the ocean, through many layers of ocean floor sediment, and back to sensitive recording devices aboard the mother ship. Using a sonarlike detection system, the mother ship can record how long it takes the sound to return to the ship, and thus is able to chart the ocean bottom. Geologists can then analyze these recordings for possible oil deposits based on the configurations of the ocean terrain.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|This invention revolutionized the oil-exploration industry. Before Chelminski's invention, oil-exploration ships used dynamite to make their explorations, which was dangerous, expensive, and often unreliable. Even the most efficient explorer ships could explode only one dynamite charge per minute. With Chelminski's air-pressure device, inexpensive, safe, and controlled "explosions" could be made every eight to ten seconds. The result was more detailed, accurate, and reliable maps. For the consumer, it meant lower prices for oil and gas.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Steve has also invented, among other things, a simpler kind of rocket booster and a new pair of shoes.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Unfortunately he never was able to make any money on the shoes.In a classic case of building a better mousetrap, but _not_ having the world\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Unfortunately, "synthetic shoes," while they lasted longer, didn't have the breathability, look, or comfort of leather. He wanted leather, but then again he didn't want leather.

Urethane is a relatively inexpensive, highly wear resistant substance. With the introduction of these urethane plugs in the soles, he found he could indeed have the best of both worlds: the comfort, breathability, and look of leather, combined with the durability of urethane. An added benefit was that the plugs acted much like the gripping studs on car snow tires and prevented him from slipping on the ice or snow.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Steve patented the idea and went looking for a licensee.

An essential prerequisite for doing this kind of market research is, of course, that MacCracken not be fearful of someone's stealing his ideas.

Nerad, when they worked together on the design of the jet engine during World War II. MacCracken tells a fascinating story about once being invited to Nerad's house for dinner. Just before sitting down to eat, they were listening to an Edward R. Murrow live report of a V-1 buzz bomb about to hit London. Nerad cranked up the radio so he could hear the sound of the buzz bomb better. Then he ran over to his piano and found a corresponding note to match the sound.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|From this sound, Nerad was able to deduce correctly to the astonishment of the War Department's top scientists, the essential mechanisms and operating principles of the bomb! How? Nerad had studied the design of pipe organs and knew that creating a desired tone required a definite volume of airspace. Different tones had different space requirements. To make the sound that it did, therefore, the buzz bomb had to be of a certain size and shape. From this size and shape information, he could then deduce the essential design and mechanisms of the bomb.Nerad and MacCracken spent most of the night doing actual diagrams and schematics of the device. They were so excited, they never did eat dinner.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The next day, they arranged a meeting with top War Department officials to present their discovery.

As its name implies, a sock puppet is a child's sock that has a character painted or sewn onto the end of it. The child can insert his hand in it, and voila! a puppet to entertain himself and his parents. Howard got the idea when he saw his son playing pretend with a sock. Inspiration struck. Simple. Obvious. And yet, how many of us with children have seen ourselves, or our children, do exactly the same thing: put one hand in a sock and play pretend? Howard was able to capitalize on this lucrative new product idea because he has trained his mind to be constantly alert for new product ideas. It's a matter of mindset and attention.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Howard's Crunch ball is a good example of another kind of mindset: continually being on the lookout for those things that are irritating, then transforming this irritation into a successful invention.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|How often have you received a package that is filled with those awful Styrofoam packing "shells" that go everywhere when you try to empty the box? This environmentally wasteful Styrofoam packing material became so irritating to Howard one day that he decided he just had to do something with it. Instead of throwing the shells away, he'd find a use for them. So Howard asked an important question: What kind of toy could he invent with this stuff? That simple question led to the invention of Crunch balls, a line of easy-to-catch indoor balls filled with Styrofoam packing shells!\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|With the right questions, you can find inspiration everywhere.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

What I particularly like about this technique is that you can generate literally an unlimited number of possible answers for so seemingly mundane and limited a task as defining the word ''imagination." Also, as with the imagination (and unlike, say, in school), there are no right or wrong answers.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The unlimited and visually individualizing elements of this technique make it particularly useful for eliciting intuitions and ill-defined, unconscious feelings about a particular assignment, topic, problem, product, or service. How does your staff really feel about that new incentive program? What would your best customers most want in a new product? What is your company's mission, and how does it translate into a vision for the future? Because the magazine cut-and-paste technique accesses the right brain, your more visual, feeling part of the brain, it truly does give you an entirely different way of _looking_ at a problem.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The ability to make the abstract visually concrete (as in the above definitions of imagination) is a hallmark of many of history's greatest scientific geniuses. Research suggests that Einstein, Edison, da Vinci, electrical inventor Nikola Tesla, and physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Michael Faraday, for instance, all had early learning disabilities with a decided preference for _visual modes of processing_ their worlds.' Not surprisingly, it was this ability to visualize that these scientists felt was most often responsible for their creative breakthroughs.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Visual Selling\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A short time ago, an electronic controls and robotics company in the Midwest asked me to help "teach their salesmen to be more creative." Of the twenty or so creativity exercises I had the sales force try throughout the day, by far the most effective was the magazine cut-and-paste exercise.

But soon they were making some truly ingenious connections. Ultimately, they discovered new, often more compelling, ways of thinking about and selling their products.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Visual "Visioning"\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Finding a workable "vision" for your company or department can be a daunting task. Ideally, the vision should be simple, short, emotionally compelling, easily internalized and remembered by staff members, aligned with short- and long-term company goals, and future- and goal oriented.

Each employee was asked to create a montage of "Resources/Library/Books/Bryan W.

One manager pasted pictures of a variety of tools (a knife, a fork, a paintbrush) in the center of her montage. As she and the other staff members discussed the relevance of her tool metaphor, they came to realize that one of the primary missions of the marketing department was to develop and disseminate "tools" that would help make other departments become successful in accomplishing their missions.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Thanks to the magazine cut-and-paste exercise, the image of "tool makers" and "tool providers" helped marketing crystallize in a simple, clear, and memorable way its broader service role within the corporation.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Visual Speechmaking\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|One of the ways to build a memorable and powerful speech is to speak in what I call word pictures.

J. Gordon, the founder of Synectics, now president of SES Associates in Cambridge, Massachusetts, feels that he has finally produced a creativity system that reliably mirrors the analogy-forming process used by history's greatest inventors and thinkers-and now available to us all.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Somewhat surprisingly, the four-part "system" takes the form of a mathematical equation.

He was part of a special Allied team assigned to clear Tripoli Harbor. The harbor was needed as a supply port for the invasion of Italy, and was therefore crucial. The Germans had scuttled a number of ships to block the harbor in such a way-with holes blocked by massive sheets of three-quarter-inch iron-that divers could not get in to patch the holes and float the ships.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A meeting was called to discuss what to do. As a naval officer was explaining the problem, Gordon noticed that an English colonel was listening with his eyes shut. After the naval officer finished, the English colonel, still with his eyes closed, spoke. (See the image streaming technique, page 92.) "Here is a ship built to specially travel great distances and yet we can't move it a few feet. A most ingenious paradox.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"When my mother rakes out her walled-in garden in the middle of London," he continued, "she always ends up with a few high mounds of dirt. She can't throw the dirt over the wall ... so she just rakes and rakes at those piles until the dirt gets spread around and disappears." 1\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

"We'll blast the ship to pieces with small cordite charges. Then we'll go down and rake the bloody mess until it's level." 2 Simple as it was, the idea worked beautifully.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|From this first encounter with the hidden workings of the creative process, Gordon was inspired to evolve the present-day SES "equation for creativity." The equation consists of four steps:\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|<br>\|---\|<br>\|\\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|---\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|1. Find the paradox inherent in your problem. 2. Find an analogue (analogy) that reflects the essence of the paradox. 3. Find the unique feature of the analogue. 4. Apply this unique feature to help you solve your problem.\\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br>\\|   \\|   \\|<br><br>1. _Find the paradox._ A problem by definition represents conflict. "And by looking for the paradox," says Gordon, "you'll force yourself to identify the core or essence of the problem you're trying to solve. Then you can find and apply a related analogue whose unique feature holds the promise, ultimately, of providing you with a truly breakthrough solution." 3  <br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|An excellent example of the SES creativity technique in action is the development of a new wound healing bandage for the Israeli Air Force Medical Corps. The paradox inherent in conventional bandages is that although they protect the wound from outside germs, they also interfere with healing because they interrupt the body's "natural physiological flow."4As Gordon's team characterized the essence of the paradox, the bandage is a _wounding bandage._\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|2. _Find an analogue (analogy) that reflects the essence of the paradox._ In this case, the team decided that the idea of fixing a cut light cord in a hurry was quite similar. "If you wind the tape carelessly you actually can put an insulating barrier between the wires you're trying to join. Thus your bandage sort of wounds the very thing you're fixing." 5\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|3. _Find the unique feature of the analogue._ In the analogue of fixing a cut electric cord, "the essential activity was to close the circuit by twisting the wires back together to reestablish the flow of electricity." 6 6\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|4. _Apply this unique feature to help you solve your problem._ When you twist wires back together, you reestablish the flow of electricity.

In the case of Pringles, it was a matter of designing a new product and package that would allow a potato chip to be manufactured at a large and efficient central plant and be transported long distances, without spoiling or breaking and without the need to fill the bag with more air than chips. In essence, it would be a compact chip that would not destruct. The paradox of compact destruction led to his analogue from nature, leaves.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"When you try to shove a load of dry leaves into one of those plastic bags, you have a hell of a time. You seem to be packing air just the way the potato chip manufacturers do." 8 But when the leaves are wet (the unique feature), they are soft and formable, and very easily packed. The reason: A wet leaf conforms to the shape of its neighbor with little room for air in between. By wetting and forming dried potato flour, the packaging problem was solved, and Pringles had its start.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Another intriguing example of the creativity equation was a communication problem at a large teaching hospital. It seems that when the hospital was small and everyone knew one another, informal, impromptu meetings took place frequently. To the hospital administrators' credit, they recognized that not only were these informal meetings and casual conversations that occurred so effortlessly good for hospital morale, but a lot of good ideas came from them. The problem was that the hospital had become a victim of its own success. With its growth came more and more employees, who knew fewer and fewer of the other employees. The camaraderie, informal meetings, and casual conversations (not to mention the good ideas) were on the decline.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As you might expect, the hospital tried a variety of ways to stimulate these casual, idea trading (and idea generating) meetings: luncheons, cocktail parties, lectures, special dinners, roundtables, etc. These meetings worked when they were held to solve specific problems, but they\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

It occurred to us that advertising in elevators would be a good way to reach potential office space clients. Although not a large assignment, it still needed to be done well. Even a medium-size commercial real estate deal could mean $100,000 or more in commissions to my client.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I'll never forget this assignment, not so much because of the results, which were very good, but because I found myself trying to visualize a solution instead of reasoning one out.

Finally, I found myself looking at the inside of the entire elevator compartment, with the elevator doors in the process of opening up. To my surprise, from these simple, effortlessly imagined Resources/Library/Books/Bryan W.

One depicted an elevator crowded with cartoon characters and the headline, "Need More Space?" Another was a drawing of an elevator panel with several of the floor buttons lit up, just as I had seen it on my mental screen. The headline read, "Are You Visiting One of Our Clients?''

One of the ideas we were considering was a new line of soft cheese spreads to make quicker and tastier grilled cheese sandwiches. Preliminary focus groups with consumers indicated that because the cheese was spreadable, they did think the "Cheese Grills" would cook up faster, but that they were not necessarily convinced that spreadable cheese would be tastier. And so the idea of adding other ingredients to the basic cheese spreads became an attractive alternative. For our grid of possibility, we listed the kinds of cheese across the top (cheddar, Swiss, Muenster) and the other ingredients down the side (bacon bits, tomato paste, olives, relish). Some interesting combinations emerged, such as Muenster Bacon, Olive Swiss, and Cheddar Relish.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Naming Grids of Possibilities\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Or consider a naming assignment we did for a new cheese Frito, where we listed all the things that our target market (males aged 18 to 25) purported to like (guns, fishing, baseball, pickup trucks, and girls) on one axis and the special qualities or descriptors of what made our snack different (better taste, more "powerful" cheese flavor, longer-lasting flavor)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Great White Cheddar, Cheddar Blasts, Cheddar Bangs, and Non- Stop Nachos were among the names generated from this exercise. And the winner? The product was launched nationally as Non-Stop Nachos.By the way, we also used the magazine cut-and-paste exercise in this assignment as a way to generate the categories of things males aged 18 to 25 liked and some feelings about what made this new cheese Frito different.

We'd offer prizes to everyone who entered our survey/contest, and even send them a summary of the results (in exchange for their business cards, of course).

In role playing, you simply pretend that you are someone else. Then you ask this "person" inside you for ideas. It is amazing, but the human mind really can imagine how someone else might think about, or even solve, a problem that "we" can't solve. We can hear what "they" have to say about it, and be the beneficiary of their advice. It's as if their voices live inside us, just waiting to be asked what they think. It's a simple, profound, and remarkably powerful technique, one that you can use either alone or with groups.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Often, when I use the technique in ideation sessions, I'll pass out identity cards with a picture and short biography of the role each person is to adopt. Some of my identity cards include photographers Mathew Brady and Ansel Adams, Florence Nightingale, Frank Lloyd Wright, Abraham Lincoln, Ben Franklin, Walt Disney, Will Rogers, Thomas Edison, Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), and Madame Tussaud (of wax museum fame). Then I'll simply go around the room, have everyone introduce "themselves," and ask for their input on the problem. _(Note:_ It's the facilitator's responsibility to make sure that everyone stays in character.)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|To role-play alone, I'd recommend having your adopted persona write "his or her" responses down.

When I went to play-test the game, however, it didn't really work. Players weren't having nearly as much fun as I'd hoped they would.And so I tried Idea Generator Plus in the hope that it could help me redesign the game. I held an imaginary brainstorming session that included, among other invited guests, my mother-in-law. It was "her" question, "Is there some way to make the game simpler?" that led me to eureka! With this simple imagined, but also very real, question from "her," I suddenly knew how to redesign the game to make it work. And work it did. Ultimately, I licensed the invention to a major game company.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Role Playing for the Navy\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Often, when I run a brainstorming session, I'll invite outside creative consultants to be part of the session.

His team was brainstorming survival techniques for downed Navy fliers and adrift Navy seamen. One of the creative techniques the group used to attack the problem was role playing. One of the participants was asked to pretend that he was Davy Jones, living in his "locker" several thousand feet below the ocean's surface. How might Davy Jones help the stranded Navy man? "Davy" got the idea that if he could continually blow bubbles up to the surface, the bubbles would form a kind of safe, air-cushioned bubble barrier to protect the Navy man both from prolonged contact with salt water and from sharks. An intriguing idea, isn't it? Does it suggest any practical new inventions?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

The idea: Have a ship surround itself with millions of tiny air bubbles to mask the sound signatures of its engines and propellers. The group became very excited about the idea and passed it on to Naval Headquarters. What ever happened to it? The group never heard.

The air bubbles created a semipermeable barrier that tended to trap sounds made by the ship, letting only a fraction of her propulsion noise escape which made the ship extremely difficult to detect.1\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The Superhero Technique\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|An intriguing variation of the role-playing technique is the superhero technique, invented by Maple Shade, New Jersey creativity consultant, author, and friend Steve Grossman. The superhero technique also involves role playing, but with an important difference from conventional ''acting-out" exercises. Because participants are asked to adopt the persona of an _imaginary_ character, they are often much freer, and therefore more likely to get into character, than if they were pretending to be a reallife person like Walt Disney or Thomas Edison. As one previously uptight participant put it, "Sometimes you have to put on a mask to take your mask off."

Everyone is then given one-half hour to create a costume out of everyday objects that might be found inside (or outside) the brainstorming room. When everyone has made a costume and reassembled in the room, the designated client begins asking each superhero for ideas to solve the problem. Incredibly, after a very few minutes, each brainstormer really does begin to adopt the persona of his or her chosen superhero.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Let's look at a real-world example.

E-Man decided to "melt the marketing vice president's lips together." Interestingly when the group further brainstormed how to make this seemingly absurd idea a reality, they got the idea of making the marketing vice-president chair of the meeting. By being made responsible for seeing that other people were heard, the marketing vice-president, at least metaphorically, would have his own lips "melted together."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In another example, U.S. Army avionics engineer Ray Clark was asked to help the manager of a regional Social Security office improve intradepartmental communication.

As its name implies, a briefing document is a written report that briefs all the session participants, generally a week or so in advance of the actual session, about the problem(s) the group is trying to solve.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The briefing document should also include creative exercises specific to the problem that encourage the participants to start getting ideas. For example, suppose you wanted to brainstorm more effective ways to communicate with your customers. Your briefing document might include exercises that forced group members to think about the nature of communication: What would be the advantages of using smoke signals rather than a telephone? If all your employees were telepathic, how might this help business? What if they couldn't hear, or see, or speak?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Or suppose you wanted to invent a line of new kitchen implements.Your briefing document might include a list of kitchen activities: e.g., dicing, slicing, shredding, boiling; identify the problems associated with these activities, e.g., cut or burnt fingers; and ask the participants for preliminary new product ideas.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In one session I facilitated to create new product ideas for a maker of polyurethane foam, we included in our briefing document an imaginary tour of the kitchen, the dining room, the bedroom, the living room, the garage, a tool shop, and a gardener's shed. By helping the participants to visualize these rooms and locations, and by providing lists of specific objects or things they might see when they got there, we helped them imagine possible new product ideas and uses for the urethane foam. One participant said the briefing document helped him to "see an ugly, brown television cord plugged into a living room wall. It made me wonder if we could create a line of designer polyurethane covers for electric cords to make them look prettier and go with the room better. Maybe they could be insulated to help prevent fires as well."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Beyond the sheer number of good (and sometimes great) ideas that\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

This should include both a brief description of the background and goal of the assignment and a general discussion of how the creative process works (why quantity of ideas leads to quality, why it's important not to be overly judgmental of one's responses, and why it's important to have fun in a session). Often I will include creative case histories to highlight these points. (For example, see the "how-to-manufacture nylon" anecdote on the value of creative horseplay, page 162.)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In the introduction, I also like to give the participants a reason for them to take the time to fill out the briefing document. Specifically I tell participants that by filling it in beforehand, they'll be inviting their subconscious minds to be part of the process. Giving their conscious minds some specific creative exercises in advance of the session will allow their _subconscious_ minds to become sufficiently primed for their creative problem-solving role in the actual session.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Next, I'll use the introduction to take some of the mystery, and possibly the fear, out of the session for those people who have never been in a formal brainstorming session before.

The second reason is to prepare the group for excursions (mental trips to other worlds) the day of the session. Often when a group's energy is low, I'll take the group on an excursion by suggesting we forget the problem for a minute and pretend, say, that it's early morning in the south of France.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

By having each participant describe what he or she dreamed of, I can create a list of possible places for the excursion that I know will be appealing to members of the group: we'll go to the Old West for the aspiring cowboy a hospital for the nurse, and outer space for the astronaut.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|_Exercise 3__:_ Because of your enthusiasm, the group has appointed you head cheerleader for this naming project.

This "poetic exercise" is designed to begin to sensitize the participants to the rhythms and cadences of words. I ask participants to create a _nonsense_ poem for two reasons. First, I don't want them to freeze up on this exercise and become overly analytical, or to try to create "Ode on a Grecian Urn" or some such thing.

At most agencies, either the CEO or the president greeted us. Several agencies even threw us parties. And since we were jogging, we were able to wear sweat pants and running shoes for our "interviews."

Wishing is the most effective way I know of to start fresh on any given problem. Wishing allows you to challenge your basic assumptions-assumptions that many times you may not even have known you were making-and get entirely new and original (not to mention fun) points of view. When for the longest time you may have felt like a beggar asking for a few crumbs of creative inspiration, wishing will turn you into a master baker of the most exciting (and delicious) creations imaginable.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Starting to Wish\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|How do you start using the wishing technique?

In the worlds of creativity and innovation consulting, a process has evolved that provides a step-by-step approach for using the wishing technique successfully. Synectics principal Jeff Mauzy has included the process in his MindLink creativity computer program. A variation of the same process is used by one of my early brainstorming faciliting coaches, Dr. Christopher W. Miller, and his Lancaster, Pennsylvania, company Innovation Focus. Unable to leave well enough alone, I have adapted and modified the principles of the basic process into a somewhat simpler, and I think more memorable, technique that I call "wishing diamonds."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As you can see in the diagram in Figure 2, there are essentially three major sections, or diamonds, in the wishing-diamonds technique. In the top half of diamond one, you start by wishing for anything and everything. (In creativity terms, this is called _divergent thinking_ and is represented by the lines making up the top half of the diamond going out, or diverging.) After generating the wishes (as many as you think appropriate), select one of the wishes on which you would like to do some further work. (In creativity terms, this process of selecting an idea is called _convergent thinking_ and is represented by the lines making up the bottom half of the diamond coming back together, or converging.)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Now you are ready to enter diamond two. The object here is to brainstorm how to make the selected wish from diamond one, no matter how far our or seemingly absurd, a reality. Since it is often impossible to do this, brainstorm how to _approximate_ the wish by achieving something similar to the desired effect. (This is where the "could we," "how about," and "what if" questions, again a divergent phase of the process, come in.) For example, suppose that in diamond one I had wished that I could travel from New York to Los Angeles instantaneously. Obviously this is not yet possible. But we can try to approximate this idea. How about doing a video teleconference? It is certainly one alternative to instantaneous travel. Or what if we gave you a coma-inducing drug in New York and an antidote to the drug in Los Angeles? For all intents and purposes, your perception would be that you had traveled from New York to LosAngeles instantaneously.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In the bottom half of diamond two, you select (the lines are once again converging) the one approximation (videoconferencing or coma) that you'd like to explore further.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Now you're ready to enter diamond three.

If the pluses far outweigh the minuses, you can proceed to an implementation strategy (the final convergence at the bottom of diamond three). If, however, there are two many minuses or challenges to the successful implementation of the idea, you can either go back to the first diamond and start ''wishing" new ideas to overcome these minuses or begin the process all over again with a different wish entirely.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Let me give a few quick, real-world examples to demonstrate the power of wishing.

This fellow had been in the business for more than ten years, and kept saying that he just couldn't imagine creating a camp activity that was new, was affordable, and that the kids would like. So we tried the wish technique. The results were wonderful, as even the skeptical camp owner admitted. One group of wishes that I particularly liked was to have Michael Jordan run a basketball clinic and Madonna give a free concert. Probably not in the camp's budget, right? But as we got to talking about how to approximate these wishes, we discovered a wonderful new camp project: Why not have the kids themselves become their favorite stars? They could make up costumes, give performances, give motivational speeches, or do whatever else they'd imagine their star doing if he or she were to visit the camp. It was a case of "when you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are, your dreams come true."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

One day, he noticed a jellyfish in the water, and it occurred to him that the jellyfish _could_ see where it was going. It got him to thinking. Could he invent a similar kind of propulsion system? It wasn't long before he had created a kind of propulsion stick with a collapsible opening and closing umbrella head. When he thrust the head out in the water, the head opened up, pushed water back, and propelled the boat forward. When he pulled the stick back, the head collapsed (creating less drag in the water), and he was ready to start his next round of pushing. So, much like a jellyfish propelling itself through water, or a gondolier pushing his boat through the canals of Venice, he could now see where he was going. A simple, yet effective imitation of nature's genius for invention and design.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Nature can provide a wealth of design ideas, concepts, and inventive approaches to the human side of new product development. I remember, for instance, in one new product session I ran for a manufacturer of steel wool pads, I led the group through a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of hair to people and animals, and why nature chose to design hair the way it did. Because hair and steel wool have a similar structure and shape (a similarity not lost on the original namer of steel _wool),_ I knew that this analogy would give us an entirely different way of thinking about potential uses and markets for a new steel wool product. The result was a new line of _radically_ different steel wool cleansing products now under development by the client.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Other examples of nature's influence on product design and invention abound.

Gordon's solution: Use underwater microphones to broadcast threatening noises that act metaphorically as nets to drive the fish to the boats for easy capture.

Maybe then you could create your own unique brand of cereal (much as people now do at home when they make granola) by combining varying amounts of rice, corn, wheat, oats, raisins, nuts, etc., that are available from large, air-tight bins at the supermarket.

Gerald had a client who was looking for ways to uncover-or create-new cost-saving ideas. Since the client had been actively pursuing cost-cutting ideas for the last five years and, as they put it, had already ''picked all the low-hanging fruit," it was up to us to design and facilitate a program that would uncover new and innovative ways of cutting costs.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|When I began thinking about how to design the session pilot, I knew one thing for sure: Cost-cutting brainstorming sessions would have to be very different from conventional brainstorming sessions.

All ideas, no matter how seemingly far out, are good and to be encouraged because often a far-out idea will have a better chance of leading to a truly breakthrough idea than a close-in or sensible idea. Any judgment of ideas is usually postponed to the end of the session, when the group comes to closure and picks the ideas that they feel should be considered for further development.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So why should a cost-cutting idea session be any different? There are several reasons. For one thing, the negatives of a cost-cutting idea need to be considered every step of the way. Otherwise, you have no way of knowing if the idea is any good or not. It's not like a new product or sales situation, where you can get your ideas, develop them, and then go ask the customers what they think. In the case of cost cutting, the employees of the company are the "consumers," and if you don't ask them when you have them there why a cost-cutting idea will or won't fly, you've lost a valuable opportunity to take advantage of their unique expertise, perspective, and experience.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Cost Cutting in the Corporate Culture\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The key thing about a cost-cutting idea is that it needs to make sense as an implementable idea within a company's unique corporate culture. A multimillion-dollar cost-reduction idea that could make good sense for one company could be disastrous for another for any number of reasons: corporate politics, effect on company morale, unique marketing environment, competitive factors, etc. The only way to really know if a potential cost-reduction idea is any good or not is to explore the ramifications of actually implementing that idea within the specific company. And that means getting the session participants to tell you the truth-to tell you what they really think (Is it doable or not doable? A good idea or a bad idea? Why or why not?). Then, if they do think it's potentially a good idea, continue brainstorming to overcome any unforeseen obstacles.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Creative cost-cutting sessions also differ from new product development sessions in the number of ideas generated. Some time ago, for instance, I ran a new product development session for a manufacturer of urethane foam in which, in a single day, a group of twelve generated more than 350 new product ideas. In a cost-cutting session, if a group is able to create a half-dozen well- developed and thought-out, implementable ideas, it has done a good day's work.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Also critical to the creative cost-cutting process is assigning dollar values to ideas. This is important for at least three reasons: (1) to help\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Without going through a "quick and dirty" cost analysis comparing the idea's potential savings with the expense of actually implementing it, you have no real way of knowing if the idea is any good or not.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|By assigning dollar values to ideas, no matter how much of a guesstimate these brainstorming-session dollar values might be, you can also quickly determine an idea's value relative to other cost-saving ideas.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Assigning dollar values also helps the group build a strong sense of achievement and purpose throughout the day. The momentum builds as the group generates ideas worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from a single day of brainstorming. There is a real sense of contribution to the company's financial well-being. Interestingly, we also found a healthy competition developing among groups and departments as word got out about "million-dollar-plus" days of cost-saving ideas. It's one thing to suggest a new idea. It's quite another thing to suggest the same idea, but include the statement, "We estimate this will save the company in excess of $150,000 per year."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So, how did we design the session to uncover or create cost-saving ideas the company had missed? There is a psychological counseling principle that I've never forgotten from my psych major days in college: "You can never fail, when you get to the detail." This simply means that if you can get your patient (or client, as they're now called) to relive past experiences, especially psychologically traumatic experiences, in great detail, much of the repressed pain that accompanied the experience will automatically be triggered and brought back to the surface.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I took a similar tack in structuring the cost-saving session-very much a specific, detailed-oriented, "bottom-up" approach to generating ideas. Start with the mundane details of an employee's everyday job, and see if contained within these everyday work experiences was a specific situation, procedure, or operation that could be generalized into a departmentwide or even companywide cost-saving idea or more efficient way of doing business.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Cutting Costs Through Mind-Mapping\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The question was, in a brainstorming session with twelve or so people, what was the easiest and most time-efficient way for each employee to generate the specific details of his or her working day? The best creative technique I know of for this purpose is mind mapping. Mindmapping was invented by Tony Buzan in the mid-1960s. Through a kind of pictorial\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

As prompts, I asked them to include on their maps such things as their day-to-day responsibilities, who they reported to, what they did and didn't like about the job, what other departments they worked with-everything.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It was only after everyone completed his or her job map that we went to work finding and developing cost-cutting ideas. With the details of their jobs fresh in their minds, and now on paper in front of them, it was a relatively simple next step to start generalizing from specific problems and inefficiencies into potentially larger, more widely applicable costsaving ideas.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|From the Specific to the General\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A good example of this specifics-to-general approach was an idea that came from the job map of an employee in the Hispanic marketing department. One of her responsibilities was to help create displays, header cards, shelf talkers, and other point-of-purchase materials for the Hispanic market. Her job map revealed that she felt she was spending an inordinate amount of time, and therefore possibly wasting money, customizing each P.O.P. piece. In essence, she was having to reinvent the wheel each time a new promotion came along. It was assumed, though, that because the Hispanic market was a specialized market, reinventing the wheel was just one of the costs of doing business in it. As we began to question this assumption, however, she realized that her department could create a series of P.O.P. templates that require only printing changes from one promotion to the next-a low-cost alternative to designing each new P.O.P. piece from scratch. What I found most interesting about this idea, however, was not simply that it was a good idea for her department.As it turned out, _all_ the marketing departments were doing exactly the same thing. By adopting her template idea, the company expects to save more than $200,000 per year.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Another intriguing advantage of using the job map technique is that\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

As in all companies, a certain very low percentage of defective products makes it through to a consumer. Most customers don't take the time or effort to let the company know about the defect. But a few do. They write to register their dissatisfaction, and ask for a refund. The company gives a full refund, but as the customer service representative's job map revealed, she wanted to do something more. She wanted to figure out a way to turn these dissatisfied customers into loyal users.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The research executive's job map revealed that she was feeling frustrated by the time and cost of finding the right people for the company's consumer research panels.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|These two problems were eventually addressed by the same cost-efficient solution: Offer the dissatisfied customers membership in a special "panel of consumer experts" that would provide the company with consumer reactions to ideas for new products and improvements on existing products. In return for their membership, customers would receive free samples, cents-off coupons, inexpensive gifts, and letters of appreciation for taking the time to "be a concerned consumer." The advantage for the research department was that it now had a group of committed, articulate, and often quite well educated customers as part of its market research panels, at a fraction of the normal recruiting cost.

Munro's response, quoted in _The New York Times,_ has stayed with me all these years. I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like, "We're not going to rebuild the engine, we're just going to play with the carburetor a little bit."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Instead of using a tired business cliche like "maximize efficiencies," Munro used words that people could relate to-and visualize.

Shakespeare called the world "a stage," and Juliet (at least through Romeo's eyes) was the sun. Novelists and journalists have long relied on analogies to give their writing an added measure of color and texture. For example, instead of using the words "rich and dishonest-looking," John McPhee once described a fellow writer as "the kind of man who looks as if he would cheat at polo." Politicians (and their speechwriters) also have recognized the power of a word picture. Think of such memorable phrases as Churchill's "iron curtain" or Bush's ''thousand points of light."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As prevalent as they are in literature, journalism, and politics, however, figurative devices are rarely used effectively in business (except, of course, in advertising). And the main reason is, I think, that it takes courage, self-confidence, and creativity to generate powerful word pictures.It's much easier to use the tired, trite, and hackneyed than to create the fresh, compelling, and new.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

The two best techniques I know of are the magazine cut and paste exercise and image streaming (see Chapter 18). Both will help you become more adept at generating and using word pictures.

The finite nature of words is imposing its limits on the infinity of creative thought. This is the danger point in any naming assignment, and it's the reason for this chapter. For those who don't wish to compromise, what follows is a list of six approaches to creative name generation that you might use to help you break "namer's block."

Whether American consumers were aware of it or not, the genesis, in part, of the Cabbage Patch concept was an ancient European superstition that girls were born inside pink roses, and boys were found under (of all things) cabbages.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Of course, striking the chord of familiarity is not limited to the naming of dolls or games, or even movie sequel titles, for that matter. In an assignment for a national bakery company, I was asked to name a new, healthier triangle-shaped cracker. The client wanted two kinds of names to test: one that said "upscale"/more expensive, and another that said lower cost/more mainstream. In both the names I proposed, I tried to strike the chord of familiarity by associating the cracker's unique shape with a known entity. For the upscale positioning, the cracker reminded me of a sail, and so we called it Spinnakers. For the mainstream positioning, I had been thinking about the success of Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers, and I suddenly realized that this cracker looked like an Angelfish!\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So which name did the client choose? Neither, unfortunately. Before we got to test the names, consumer research revealed that our healthy cracker had a problem with its shape. Consumers were worried that they might choke on the points of the triangles. The project quickly lost the wind from its sails.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Finally, striking the chord of familiarity may be as subtle as using a few of the same letters and adapting a graphic "look" or design from something else. Consider the story behind one of the most expensive name changes ever undertaken: the switch in the early 1970s from Esso to Exxon.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Like many naming assignments these days, this one began with a computer search. Hundreds of names were generated, many beginning with _E_ to maintain some identification with the "old" Esso name. Unfortunately, none of the computer's creations tested well. After months of unsuccessful testing, the problem was, in part, solved-not by a computer but by a secretary who found a way to strike the chord of familiarity.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Sometimes it's useful to step back and ask yourself two of marketing's most basic questions: What makes your product or service unique, and who is your market? If you're not absolutely clear on how to answer these questions, often you'll find yourself creating names that "just don't feel right" because intuitively you know that they're communicating the wrong message and/or positioning. Conversely, when you very clearly know your market and what makes your product or service unique, that focus, like a well-aimed arrow, can lead you to a naming bull's-eye rather quickly.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Think about Nabisco's vanilla sandwich cookie Giggles. What do you remember as the essence of your lunchroom eating experience in elementary school? I can't help but see my silly, goofy, laughing, giggly classmates shooting spitballs, throwing cold mashed potatoes across the room, and spitting out warm milk into their jello. When I remember how lunchtimes were, calling a cookie Giggles, and even adding a baked-in smile to the "face" of the cookie, seems to me the essence of great naming.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Another good example of "essence naming" is the highly successful product Success Rice. When Robert Homan's New York-based New Products Resources did research on boxed rice, they discovered that consumers wanted a quick, foolproof way to make delicious rice. With the then-new boil-in-the-bag technology, this had become possible. Unconventional as it was, they gave the product a name that captured the essence of what consumers were saying they wanted when preparing their rice: success.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Of course, finding the essence of your naming assignment is not always easy.

On an assignment to name an environmental book club for a well-known publishing house, for instance, I struggled for weeks trying to find the essence of what I wanted the name to convey. But it wasn't until I saw a road sign that said ELM STREET that I suddenly realized what the naming assignment was all about. The name of the book club should communicate a sense of nature (elm) in balance with civilization (street). Once I had made this positioning discovery, it was relatively easy to generate a half dozen on-target, winning names.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I guess in this case finding the essence was a combination of dogged determination and keeping the problem top of mind until somewhere, somehow, something triggered the answer.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Find the Visual\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As right-brained art directors know, many creative marketing problems are solved by finding the appropriate visual. The same visual approach to problem solving can be applied to the decidedly left-brain, language oriented goal of finding a new product name. If you can find the appropriate picture, the single best name may quickly follow.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I once worked on the naming of a new sore throat sprayer. This carry anywhere, use-anytime sore throat medication was packaged in an innovative spray bottle that let you spray medication directly to the sore spot in your throat. For the spray to hit its target, the user's mouth had to be opened fairly wide. In a moment of reverie, thinking of the opened mouth somehow elicited an image of a lion tamer sticking his head inside the wide-open mouth of a lion. The name "Throat Tamer: to soothe the 'roar' of sore throat pain" was not far behind.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A copywriter friend of mine had a similar visual naming experience.He was asked to name a new candy bar that was unique because of its white chocolate covering and red stripes.

Visuals, in and of themselves, obviously are everywhere. On TV, in magazines, in books. Everything we see in the outside world. Everything we can imagine (or remember) in our inside world. Visuals indeed are everywhere. So, much like the process of essence finding, discovering the right visual can be a rather random, hit-or-miss process. Ultimately, success comes from a combination of the namer's motivation and determination, attention, synchronicity, and/or luck. The key, though, is to be ready when the visual appears.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It's a mysterious process.

What was it about that movie that made it so enjoyable? What makes one product's positioning so much better than another's? Why is a particular novel such a good read? For those who collect principles, creative problem solving can become an enormously fun game of adapting a principle to fit an entirely different set of creative problems. Naming is no exception. When you analyze what makes a great name great, you can't help but discover naming principles that might help you solve your particular naming assignment.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What makes L'Eggs such a wonderful name for pantyhose? Beyond, of course, telling you what the product is for, it uses the provocative naming strategy of linking the name directly with the product package, an egg-shaped plastic container. So, how might you use this same strategy to name a new self-heating sink powder that "blasts away stains and grease"? You might call it Powder Keg, and package it in a keglike container.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What naming principle is inherent in the doggie treat Snausages?

There have been many such services on the market with rather forgettable names, like _The New Product Newsletter, New Products and Processes,_ and _Innovation News._ I wanted my name to "cut through," to be both memorable and innovative. I looked to other successful names for a transferable principle. The information search company FIND/SVP (SVP stands for _s'il vous plait)_ provided the answer. I applied its acronymic approach to naming and created _The P.O.I.N.T.

Personnel from every department were assembled to brainstorm how to reengineer the process to make it more efficient, user-friendly simple, and cost-effective.

The exercises we ultimately selected (from among the more than two dozen we considered) were included to meet very well-defined and specific business objectives. Among the criteria we used to design and select the included exercises were considerations of group size, participant experience with brainstorming (limited), participant thinking styles (as a whole, quite process-oriented), stated corporate and session objectives, and time of day. We also spent a considerable amount of time deciding in what order, and for what length of time, each exercise should be presented for maximum effect and result. Much as an Olympic gymnast might envision each and every move of a routine before giving the actual performance, we visualized the steps and anticipated results for each and every exercise to make sure that the exercise contributed to the objectives of the overall session. Paradoxically, it's the best planned sessions that allow the greatest free flow of "unplanned" creative problem-solving ideas to emerge.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Day 1: How Things Are\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Day one of the two-day session ran from 12:30 P.M. to 6:30 P.M.

Exercise one, therefore, was to create a detailed visual representation or "process map" of each step in the process. We did this by simply recording the details of each step on flip chart paper and posting the lists around the room. The order of the steps was determined by the life cycle of the container itself, from initial manufacture to return for recycling. Problems in the process were duly noted, but no effort was made to solve these problems. That would come later. For now, we were simply trying to understand and visualize the overall process. This process mapping exercise took an hour and a half and was followed by a ten-minute break.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|At 3:00 P.M. we randomly assigned the participants to three breakout groups for a series of customer role-playing exercises. Since there were primarily three groups of "customers" along the distribution chain, we had each of the three groups pretend that it was one of the customers, essentially acting as a focus group to record its perceptions and give us an objective view-both good and bad-of the returnable container program. We included this exercise to help the participants get "outside themselves" and their specific roles in the process, and begin to empathize with the concerns, needs, and priorities of their _customers._ We hear\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Each team was given the specifications for one of two new products ostensibly designed by rival research and development departments within their company.The new products were intended to offer a kind of competitive brand insurance against the likelihood that their currently marketed product (the one group was there to process reengineer) would some day lose market share to an outside competitor.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The wrinkle was that only one of the two proposed new products would be funded by management.

(Each of the two new products, incidentally was given an imagined name along with detailed product specifications before being assigned to a team.) We allowed each team an hour and a half to create a presentation. At 6 P.M. sharp, each group took ten minutes to make its presentation to a fictional board of directors (actually three of the company's top marketing people). The winner was to be announced the next morning, with each winning team member receiving "valuable prizes."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|This turned out to be a tremendously successful exercise for several reasons:\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It helped management anticipate potential new product introductions from actual competitors.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It helped each team member understand the strengths and weaknesses of the company's current product's manufacturing and distribution system.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It suggested ways to strengthen the product's manufacturing and distribution system by considering other product innovations.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It took advantage of the competitive spirit of the team members and turned what often is a low-energy time (the end of the day) into a high-energy, exciting, and worthwhile exercise for the company and the participants.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Day 2: How Things Could Be\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Day two began at 8:00 A.M. with an announcement of the previous night's winners.

You'd be surprised how often groups, after several hours of brainstorming, discover that they've been trying to solve the wrong problem.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Three teams were randomly formed and given the assignment of identifying which problems they thought were the most critical. Teams were given forty-five minutes to select and rank their choices. The groups were then given another thirty minutes (ten minutes for each group) to report on their decisions. Finally, using a group decision technique called "dot voting," the group as a whole came to a consensus as to which problems to work on. (See page 169.)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|With a break, this took us to 10:15 A.M. Now, with the problems clearly identified and ranked in terms of priorities, it was time to begin actual problem solving. I spent the next forty-five minutes training the group in three simple, yet powerful, creative problem-solving techniques: mindstorming, brainwriting, and wishing diamonds. (See page 109.) In each case, I demonstrated how to apply the technique by actually using it to solve one of the identified problems.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Mindstorming and Brainwriting\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Mindstorming is an individual creative technique that involves simply writing down a pre-determined number of ideas for solving any given problem. Simple as it sounds, it is a surprisingly effective technique. Typically when we try to solve a problem, we settle for the first "really good idea" that comes along. Rarely do we try to generate more ideas, especially when the first idea truly does solve the problem. When you have to generate a predetermined number of ideas or solutions, however, you can't stop with the first good idea that comes up. You've got to keep going until you reach your goal (I find ten to be a good idea goal for beginners, twenty for more experienced ideators). The technique forces quality out of quantity. Interestingly many of the best and most imaginative ideas occur at the end of the exercise, at ideas 8, 9, and 10. Why? I think it's a combination of sometimes getting the old or obvious ideas out first and a tendency for people to allow themselves to entertain farther-out (even sillier) ideas at the end of the exercise as they try to reach their goal.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The second technique, brainwriting, is a great technique when you have a lot of people in a session and would like to generate a ton of ideas very quickly. The way it works: Divide your large group into smaller groups of, say, five people each. Each person then writes down a thought\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Then each person passes the paper on to the next person, who writes down a follow-up suggestion based on what the first person has said. The papers are passed again and again until everyone has had a chance to write on all the papers and each person has gotten his or her original paper back. It's fast moving, fun, very stimulating-and generates literally hundreds of ideas in a very short time. It also gets everyone involved in a nonthreatening way: It's much easier to write down a "silly" idea than to say it in front of thirty other people. An added plus is that the technique can easily be adapted to a companywide brainstorming session by using networked computers.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Problem solving lasted through lunch until 1:00.

We spent the rest of the day (from 2:00 to 3:45) grouping the ideas, prioritizing them, and creating action plans for each high-priority idea, including who was responsible for doing what, when, and with what desired outcome.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|If you're wondering how we prioritized so many ideas with such a large group, we used a simple four-box grid (see Figure 3).

But all of us are funny.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|![cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif](cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif)\|   \|   \|![cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif](cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Let's look at some of the benefits and uses of humor for the business manager looking to achieve specific business goals. There are at least six. Humor can be used: (1) as a way to "break the ice" in stiff, or uncomfortable business situations, 2) as an effective bonding technique, a wonderful way to build common ground with other employees, (3) as a way to break down resistance to your own point of view, (4) as a much needed way to improve the content, enjoyment, and ultimately the productivity of meetings, (5) as a way to assign work when people "can't take any more," and (6) as a wonderful way to ease and control tension.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|![cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif](cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif)\|   \|   \|![cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif](cf2d317a6ba238c9109b9e60f228b923.gif)\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|And what about the personal benefits of humor to the business manager? These include: (1) a way to relieve stress, (2) a way to achieve a more positive perspective on a particular assignment or setback, (3) a way to advance your career people like to work with people they like and can have fun\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

The traffic manager, Brian, it seems, had forgotten to mail a critical piece of artwork that Steve had promised the client "yesterday." Needless to say, Steve was not happy. Brian's response (delivered with deadpan seriousness): "I have one foolproof way to remedy this problem.

Each week the company writes and produces a thirty minute comedy package that is syndicated to more than 250 radio stations across the nation. The package includes comedy skits and song parodies on current events, politicians, TV, the movies, etc. Some of the regular characters (in part because the company has actors that do a good job of imitating them) are Barney Fife (of Mayberry RFD); Ralph Kramden of the Honeymooners; Tom BrokeJaw, anchor person; Mr. Ed; and of course, the President of the United States, usually sounding like pretty much of an idiot.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I had been invited to attend the weekly brainstorming session because, well, I asked. I had read about this company in a local newspaper, and I was curious about how a group of people could, week-in, weekout, meet the creative demands of writing and producing a half hour of comedy. I knew that creatively they must have figured out a system, and I was curious about what this system might be. I was also interested in what kinds of people chose to write comedy for a living. Most of all, though, I was interested in how they ran their creative sessions. I felt I might learn something that could help me in my own facilitating work.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|And so I drove the half hour from my office to Bridgeport to attend their weekly brainstorming session.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|When I arrived at the American Comedy Network's offices, there was no receptionist, so I walked back to where I heard laughter.

The goal of this meeting was to get as many ideas out as quickly as possible. Everyone knew there'd be time to write the specifics of each skit later. Right now they were looking for the big ideas. How much better would most of our meetings in business be if we focused primarily on the search for big ideas and left the detail work to much smaller teams or groups later?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So what can the business manager in search of better meetings and brainstorming sessions learn from the American Comedy Network?

It gives the other group members permission to be the same way. Remember what Steve Cony said, "There is no faster way of building trust and intimacy with another person (or group) than by your willingness to poke a little fun at yourself."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

And as the lord of his castle, the manager would lower his drawbridge to the outside world (other company departments, or the customer) only when he deemed it safe or necessary to do so. The lord manager spent much of his time protecting his fiefdom lest his power be usurped by other, more ruthless lord managers. The system made for great political intrigue, but frustrated the hell out of outsiders in need of supplies or services. Who, after all, wants to wait three weeks for a lousy wheel for his cart, hay for her ox, or a new blade for the plow simply because the lord manager can't get his act together? It's easier now just to move on to friendlier kingdoms.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Global competition has forced American business to reorganize from its traditional hierarchical structure of management (and the attendant fortress mentality) to a cross-functional, interdepartmental, interdependent style of doing business.

Dick specializes in doing internal customer satisfaction surveys, and he had just completed an extensive survey on behalf of the client. The survey revealed a number of service shortcomings in one of the company's data processing divisions and so it seemed like a good idea (at least at the time) to bring me in to conduct a creative problem-solving session on "how to improve customer service."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Twenty of the division's top managers and service administrators were assembled, I was introduced, and there we were ready to brainstorm some new ideas. Or so I thought.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The first hour of our meeting had been devoted to reviewing the survey results as a way of helping us all identify the problem areas that needed the brainstorming work. But since the results, at least in some areas, were not particularly good, it soon became apparent that many of the managers were both angry and defensive. Not a particularly healthy environment for generating new ideas, now is it?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As the anger grew, I knew it was going to be, at best, a long day. The question was, what should I, or could I, do to make the day productive? I did know that before we could hope to accomplish anything at all, we'd need to get the anger out. Otherwise, we'd just be kidding ourselves.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So I did something I very seldom do in a brainstorming session.

You might say the dam burst. Everyone angrily insisted that the survey results weren't valid, or it was mostly top management's fault (lack of support), or they had inherited bad systems anyway, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah! I asked a few nonjudgmental, prompting questions as the session proceeded (what do you mean by that? is that true of all groups? does everyone agree on this?) but for the most part I stayed out of it.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Intuitively I knew that to be an effective leader of the brainstorming session, I had to distance myself from the anger-release part of the session.

I knew that Dick Mathews was wondering why, as the facilitator, I wasn't doing my job. So much for my supposed ability to lead effective, nonjudgmental brainstorming sessions. This was turning into a hostile free-for-all; some might say it was getting ugly.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|And still I hung back.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I began to feel the frustration in the room build to a level that I can only describe as "frantic tenseness."

He called on people, pleaded, cajoled; at times he even became quite dictatorial. But at least now that terrible indecision was gone. The group had a leader.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It wasn't long before I sensed my chance to take back control of the group. The anger was gone, everyone had had his or her say, and we were ready to do some true brainstorming work. Since I was still in the front of the room, marker pen in hand, with flip charts at the ready, it was relatively easy for me to get back my leadership role by simply starting to write ideas down and asking "tell me more"-type questions. As it turned out, the senior manager and I, for all intents and purposes, ended up co-facilitating the group. He became the disciplinarian "bad cop"; I was the ever-open, sensitive, nonjudgmental "good cop." Incredible as it may seem, we really did get some terrific ideas out of that session.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Leading a Brainstorming Session\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Just as nature abhors a vacuum, a group abhors a leaderless meeting. So, recommendation 1: Unless you've got a very good reason not to (as I think I did in this case), if you've been asked to lead a group, then lead it. Just as every child needs a parent, every group needs a leader. Take charge. Assign. Dictate (without being dictatorial). Cajole. Charm. Listen.Laugh. Ask question after question after question. Have fun. A group wants and needs to be led. If you as the leader don't, someone else will have to.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|What does it take to successfully lead a group? Three things. One is energy and enthusiasm. Leading a group, much like performing on stage or giving a motivational speech, requires that you "outflow energy" to help build the group's spirit and enthusiasm. Think of yourself as a kind of human electrical outlet filled with juice just waiting to flow through you. If you're not letting the group members plug into your power source,\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

This will come with practice. Ideally, when you're leading well, you will be both empty (with few or no preconceived ideas) and "in the moment." Much like a Zen master, if you can attain this state of "empty nowness," you'll be the perfect vessel for facilitating the ideas and insights of each group member. You'll be listening intently to what everyone has to say, and ultimately helping the group get the most creative mileage out of each contributed idea.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Third (and somewhat of a contradiction to point 2), you need to pay attention to your feelings. All the creative techniques in the world won't get you anywhere if you're not being sensitive to what your gut is telling you. If you're feeling uneasy about where the group is (or isn't) going, there's a reason for it. Don't be afraid to explore these feelings with the group. Paradoxically, you may find, as I often have, that if you can learn not to be afraid of what's not working, you'll get back to work a lot faster.It takes sensitivity to read the emotional climate of the group, and courage to explore with the group what may _not_ be being said. If you can be honest about your feelings, the group will be honest with you about theirs. If you want a rule of thumb, it's this: What you're most afraid of doing is exactly what you should be doing.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

(You remember Silly String: It was the stuff Tom Hanks shot from his nose in the movie _Big.)_ Our brainstorming session had gotten a tad out of hand, and someone had managed to cover me (the facilitator) with the stuff, and a good part of the room as well. We all looked a little sheepish, like junior high kids who had been caught shooting spitballs, when the steward came in to bring us more refreshments for the afternoon session.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"Could he smell the stuff burning?"

I had taken a major risk in the design of a new product brainstorming session for a leading food company. I took the risk because I knew most of the session participants would be relatively young-in their late twenties and early thirties. And as with all "good" risks, I felt relatively confident that it would work. The downside was that if it didn't work, I would appear foolish and entirely unprofessional.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I knew, both from my own facilitating experience and from the research, that the best and most productive creative sessions were, above all, fun: Fun for the facilitator to facilitate and fun for the participants to be a part of. So the obvious question was, How could I make creative sessions more fun? The answer, at least to me, was also obvious: Bring in toys and games to the session, and let people "play."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Lincoln logs, yo-yos, hula hoops, dart guns, Pez, Silly Putty, Nerf Balls, superballs, Silly String: I was a kid in a candy shop/toy store.

I can't say that it felt quite like Disney World, but it was close. There's nothing quite like a room full of toys for setting the right mood for a creative session. Toys as creative props have since become a staple of most of my creative sessions, especially when we're working on a new product development assignment.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Playing at Creativity\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Does all this sound like a little much? A little too childish? Or maybe even a case of just trying too hard? Before you scoff at the idea, consider that there are some very sound psychological principles at work behind the design of these playful creative sessions. For one, it's a way to let your participants know, right off the bat, that this creative session is going to be a fun, hopefully nonthreatening event. Many people, especially first timers, come to a creative session scared to death. Part of the reason is simply not knowing what to expect, having a natural fear of the unknown. But there is also the fear of not being creative, especially when there's the added pressure of having to be creative in a group. Anything the facilitator can do to alleviate some of this fear is a good thing.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Consider also that when people are in a relaxed, playful, and funloving state, they are more likely to _make unexpected creative connections._Their minds are free from judgment and worry, and therefore free to free-associate. If you doubt this, try coming up with a new idea when you're afraid or angry. It's very hard, if not impossible, to do.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Also toys and games, from a psychological/neurological-conditioning standpoint, are linked in most adults' memories with the play and fun of childhood. What quicker way, then, to elicit the childhood state than to use the toys we all played with as children as psychological memory triggers?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|There's also the possibility (more likely than you might think) that one or more of these toys might help to stimulate an exciting new product idea.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Finally, the toys make the session breaks more fun.

Clarke "Matti" Mattimore, was part of a special propaganda unit made up of some of the nation's most talented idea men: advertising executives, Pulitzer-prize winning authors, and award-winning photographers and graphic designers. I remember two things in particular that he told me about being in this unit: First, he said, it was the happiest and most fulfilling time of his life, and second, it was like going to an out-of-control kindergarten classroom every day. These guys were constantly horsing around and getting in all kinds of trouble-paper airplanes out the window, shooting paper clip "bullets" at their commanding officer, all kinds of entirely juvenile pranks. They also did some of the finest creative work-recruitment posters in particular-of any single creative group in the war. I always felt that their brilliant creative work and their continual horsing around must somehow be related. I now know that they were. True creativity is, as one philosopher put it, an act of destruction, exchanging the old for the new, the tried for the never been tried, the conventional for the original. To be creative, you must be dissatisfied with the status quo. You must challenge authority. This horsing around was challenging the status quo. The group's creative work also was challenging the status quo.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|By the way, if you are wondering how they were able to get away with their creative tomfoolery, it was because they were all officers. Apparently, short of a court-martial, it is very difficult to take disciplinary action against an officer. They knew that despite his threats, the commanding officer was not going to court-martial them for shooting paper clips.Imagine how foolish he'd look filing the charges.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The Wet-Tongued Napkin\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I'm always interested in what thoughts lead to a breakthrough idea. For an article I was researching on play and the creative process, I came across a team of inventors in Chicago that had an interesting story to tell. Henry Arias and Denise Heimrich founded their Chicago-based company Thinking Heads several years ago to invent and license new toys and games. They went out to lunch one day, and in a playful mood, Denise, as a child might, picked up a napkin and stuck her wet tongue through it at her partner. She started laughing, but her partner Henry suggested, "We might have something here." For some time they had been trying to invent a very low cost, simple action game for young kids. Until Denise put her tongue through the napkin, they had been coming up somewhat dry. The tongue through the napkin bit of childlike spontaneity was the creative spark that inspired Denise and Henry to invent the successful\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

If you haven't seen Thin Ice, it is ingeniously simple. Kids spread a tissue over a raised platform to form the ''ice." Below the "ice" is a water-filled reservoir with marbles in it. Kids pick up the wet marbles with "ice tongs" and place them, one by one, on the tissue. The first kid to add the marble that "breaks through the thin ice" (like Denise's wet tongue going through the napkin) loses. Simple, fun-and very inexpensive to produce.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Looking for Mister Longstocking\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Finally, in a somewhat less frivolous, but no less playful invention, I have a story about the commercialization of nylon. Many people know that DuPont research chemist Dr. Wallace Carothers invented nylon (known then as Polymer 66) in 1934. What many people do not know is that virtually nothing was done with the invention (it wasn't even patented) until Julian Hill, a colleague of Carothers', found a way to increase the tensile strength of Carothers' basic discovery. One day, while playing around with the substance, Hill noticed that he could stretch the strands of the material quite far into a thin string. In a bit of creative horseplay, apparently when Carothers, the lab director, had gone downtown to run an errand, Hill got together a number of his co-workers to run down the halls of the office building to see how far they could stretch the stuff. As it stretched further and further down the hallway, they noticed that the extended strands were becoming quite silky in appearance. This silkiness signaled to the engineers that the molecules of the polymer were lining up, and that the strength of the substance would therefore increase, which was exactly what had happened. Hill's discovery became known as the cold-drawing process and led to the commercialization of nylon, DuPont's most important and successful product ever.1\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So, what's the moral of these anecdotes?

One is, separate the idea generation stage of the process from the judgmental stage; the other is, generate as many ideas as you can because ultimately quantity breeds quality. But of course, all rules, especially when it comes to creativity and the creative process, are made to be broken. These two are certainly no exceptions.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|That being said, I thought I'd share some of the brainstorming tricks of the trade I have learned over the years.

Most of us talk at about 120 words per minute. Network news commentators speak at the rate of about 160 words per minute. Muschutto clocks in at 365 words per minute. But research with the visually impaired shows that with some practice, we can still understand what's going on at 600 words per minute or more.Quite incredible, isn't it?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The implication for the brainstorming facilitator, and for the seminar participant, is that no matter how fast or compelling the things that one may be saying are, each of us has three to four times as much in-between time to think about other things. In the psychological literature, this is known as in and out thinking. The "in" time is when you're concentrating on what the speaker is saying. The "out" time is when you're thinking about other, often unrelated things: what you had for breakfast, what to get your wife or husband for a birthday, when you're going to paint the house. If you like, think of the out time as daydreaming.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Research has also shown, not surprisingly, that out time increases when the listener perceives the subject matter being presented as boring\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Are you listening to me?), the more likely the listener is to go out.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In any brainstorming session (especially in an all-day affair), obviously you are going to have a great deal of in and out thinking going on.The trick for the facilitator is not to prevent out thinking (which is impossible anyway), but to acknowledge it as a natural part of the process and give the participants the freedom they need, both physically and mentally, to help them get back in when they realize they are spending more time out than in.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Allowing people to do physical things and not be tied down to a chair all day is the most effective way I know of to help people get back in. By allowing and indeed encouraging physical distractions, mental out time and daydreaming will be significantly reduced. Therefore, as the facilitator, you should encourage your participants to stand up when they feel like standing, doodle when they feel like doodling, and play with a toy when they feel like playing.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I remember once facilitating a half-day session for a group of high-energy salespeople. This was an extraordinary group of mostly men: smart, personable, and honest. They also had an extremely high level of energy, both as a group and individually. I knew it would be a challenge to keep them motivated and "in" the process.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Encouraging them to get up and walk around gave their physical energy an outlet, so that they could more efficiently focus their mental energy on the task at hand. The result was that we had a very productive session together. It was wonderful to see their energy and enthusiasm being so powerfully brought to bear on the problem. Do you know that when we finally arrived at our breakthrough idea (a new selling strategy), almost everyone was literally standing around me in a kind of makeshift football huddle? It was as if we had somehow just won the big game together.

In essence, he said that the key to successful group process could be summarized in a single word: risk. The primary job of the facilitator is to establish a climate where each participant can feel safe taking risks. Like all timeless truths, it's simple, but not necessarily easy.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I remember my first formal brainstorming session at a large New York ad agency shortly after graduating from college. I walked into that session as an open, trusting, somewhat naive "idea kid" who was looking to contribute as many ideas as he could to "land that new airline account." I walked out totally disillusioned, and kind of sad. It was a shock to see the president of the agency, someone I had previously respected, throw a kind of psychic power net over the entire proceedings. That supposed brainstorming session wasn't about creating new ideas. It was about politics and power and fear and manipulation.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Building Trust\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|This brings up an interesting point about the makeup of a brainstorming group. In my experience, the single most important question you as facilitator can ask is, Who will be the most senior member or boss in the group, and what is his or her relationship with the other participants? Unless you have a truly superior manager, someone who really does believe in empowering the people that work for him or her, you may be in for a less than stellar session. If the relationship between "the boss" and his or her co-workers is about power, and therefore fear, you're not going to be seeing a great deal of creative risk taking among the other members of the group. And without risk taking, you have little hope of getting a truly original idea.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A case in point is a series of three creativity training and brainstorming sessions I ran for the Los Angeles manufacturing plant of an international packaged goods marketer. In all three sessions we had a wide range of ethnically diverse participants from all levels and departments within the company, along with a senior manager. Sessions one and three were two of the best sessions I've ever conducted. We generated some great ideas, and without exception the group participants greatly appreciated the creativity training. Credit for the success of these sessions was due,\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Some of his power plays were subtle; others were blatantly aggressive attacks. Those brave souls who did speak up were quickly beaten down, despite my attempts to defend them, and the others in the group quickly learned that the safest thing to do was to just keep quiet.The irony was that by the end of the day, after relentless attempts on my part to build some level of trust and creative risk taking, the guy finally did start to come around. When we got past his insecurities (masked by an aura of presumed self-confidence), he actually proved to be quite talented and creative. Even some members of the group began to catch the spirit and make valuable contributions. It was a shame, though, that we had to waste most of the day dealing with this guy's insecurities before we could make any progress.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|By the way, if you're interested in how one goes about trying to build some level of trust in this kind of situation, my approach has always been to enlist the problem person as a kind of ally. Recognizing that a problem person's fears and insecurities often translates to a need to be in control, I ask them for advice on how to proceed with the facilitating of the session, "since this is obviously a more difficult assignment than we had previously thought." With this tack, all but the most cynical of bosses will quickly become the facilitator's ally and make all kinds of suggestions, often surprisingly good ones, as to how best to proceed.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Concerns about the issue of sexual harassment aside, one surefire way to know that your brainstorming session is "happening" is when you, the facilitator, begin to hear the participants throw out quips, jests, japes, and jokes that are rife with sexual innuendo. When this happens, invariably you know you're well on your way to having a good session.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|However, don't expect the sexual knee- (or would that be thigh?) slappers to start right away. It takes some building before the sexual innuendoes, or, if you're lucky, blatantly sexual remarks, occur. Generally, the group starts out with some good-natured joking: nothing particularly risqué, just some polite witticisms. This is stage one in the loosening-up process. The best session participants will invariably have a good sense of humor anyway (often mixed with a liberal dose of irreverence), so it's not surprising that pretty quickly, even during the introductions, someone will start making wisecracks.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Then, as the group members get to know each other better and feel more comfortable with one another, the jokes become increasingly off-color and risqué. All in all, it's a very natural process, this progression from polite, witty banter to total debauchery. It's an evolution, though, that can't and shouldn't be forced by the facilitator. The goal of total debauchery much like the feeling among best friends, has to evolve over time and emerge naturally out of the collective group consciousness.Some groups never reach it. Other groups, especially if they're filled with "characters" (wild and crazy creative types), almost always do.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Why is sexual innuendo an important barometer of the evolution of a group? It's a signal that the formal has yielded to the informal, that repression has given way to spontaneity, that fear has been replaced by fun, and ultimately that posturing has been superseded by honesty. In my experience, there is also no better demonstration that a feeling of mutual trust has been built among the group members than having jokes about sex. Think about it. Would you tell a dirty joke to someone you didn't know well? Of course you wouldn't. If you did, most likely you'd\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Guards have been let down sufficiently for the participants to actually say the first thing that comes to their minds, without feeling afraid that they'll be made to look foolish or, worse yet, perverted.And when you get this kind of spontaneity, you can't help but get true creativity as well.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I can remember one creativity training session I did for a group of high-tech salespeople. Without in any way trying to disparage the fundamentalist religious point of view, I've got to tell you that this one fellow, who was the devoutest of devout fundamentalists, was the most difficult "student" I have ever had. He could not, in any way, allow himself to even entertain the possibility that the training session could be of some value to him, much less fun. He was there only because his boss had told him he had to be.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Closed-minded as he was, I also had to admire the guy. True to his belief, when we did the final debriefing on what he had learned from the day's training, he said, "absolutely nothing-it was a complete and total waste of my time." Yes, I had to admit, I did respect the guy's honesty, and indeed courage, in expressing his unique point of view. Honesty is an important personality characteristic of the best brainstorming participants. Honest as this guy was, though, somehow he'd not have been my first choice to head a team of all-star brainstormers. His fundamentalist point of view didn't seem to include the word "fun"-or much of a sense of humor, for that matter, which is also a personality trait of the best brainstormers.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|To Post or Not to Post?\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Most facilitators use the rather archaic system of recording ideas on flip chart paper and then posting these sheets around the room as they fill up with ideas. Of course, there are now electronic blackboards on the market that will give you an 8 1/2 by 11 printout of anything you've written on a large blackboard. Unfortunately, because of the limited electronic blackboard space, you won't have a running record of your ideas that you can post around the room.

By posting the flip chart sheets with often hundreds of ideas on them, you have a concrete record of the group's progress for everyone to see.

When the ideas are displayed around the room, they will often trigger even more new ideas. Sometimes, for instance, a participant will see an idea and have a "build" on that idea that suddenly makes it viable, or potentially more exciting. Other times a posted idea will trigger an entirely new concept.Occasionally someone will make a connection between two seemingly unrelated ideas that makes for an even more exciting third idea. In fact, it's often a good exercise at the end of the day to have everyone walk around the room looking for ways to combine "old" ideas into "new" ideas.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I remember, for instance, a session I did for the Connecticut Urban League (a nonprofit inner-city job training organization) to generate new fund-raising programs. At one end of the room was an idea to start an executive networking service so that current corporate contributors could help us recruit new corporate contributors. At the other end of the room was an idea to find out the favorite causes (literacy training, AIDS, employment, housing for the homeless, etc.) of the most powerful local CEOs and see if the Urban League might help in some way to further those causes, in return for a donation. It was natural to combine the two ideas to make each more practical, focused, and doable. The concept: Use the executive network to do the research for us. It gave the executive networkers an excuse to call other CEOs other than just for fund-raising and it promised them a warmer reception when they actually did call because they were asking about the CEO's favorite cause.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Finally posting the ideas around the room makes it easier to bring the group to closure and have group members pick the ideas that they think are the most exciting and have the greatest potential for further development.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Dot Voting\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|As you may know, a critical element of any brainstorming session is withholding judgment.

In ten minutes (or less) it becomes obvious which ideas the group considers to be the winners.

When you've been very successful and made some brilliant marketing decisions, sometimes the only place to go is down. Marketing began second-guessing itself and taking longer and longer to make decisions. Consequently, more and more pressure was being put on manufacturing to meet the impossible deadlines created by marketing's indecision.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|One of the problems was that these manufacturing people were, in a sense, _too_ good. They invariably rose to the challenge and met the impossible-to-meet deadline. And so, human nature being what it is, marketing came to take it for granted that manufacturing would and could do the impossible. Yes, manufacturing could and did. But they came to resent being taking advantage of by "the stars" (read as prima donnas) in marketing. When emergencies become commonplace, it begins to take its toll.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|It was also costing the company a great deal of money in rush printing charges, wasted formulations, product overstocks, etc. The conservative estimate was that the company was spending an extra $15 million per year because of marketing's failure to make timely decisions.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|We spent the first hour of our brainstorming session identifying the problem and getting the anger out. But then, with the problem well identified and the anger dissipated, the next question was, of course, what could we do to mitigate, if not solve, the problem? How could manufacturing put pressure on marketing to get them to make timely, cost-effective decisions? We began brainstorming possible solutions without much success. So I did what I often do when things aren't going well. I had the group take a break.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

For one, it helps the group members get away from the problem and encourages a level of objectivity that is difficult to achieve in the heat of a brainstorming session.

Somehow, magically, while you're chatting with one of your brainstorming buddies about the weather or how great the Bulls are doing, the subconscious is working away on the problem, often making unexpected associations and connections. The metaphor it brings to mind is that of a ham radio operator.When the operator's sending a message (i.e., brainstorming), he can't receive one. But when he stops sending, his radio will pick up whatever's in or on the air. For me, ''what's in the air" is the same as what's waiting to be heard from the subconscious. It's like Norman Lear says, "If you let it, the subconscious will always slip you little notes with answers written on them."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Taking a break also gives the facilitator time to decide on a new direction, creativity strategy, or technique that he or she feels will have the greatest chance of success.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Occasionally, I'll even get "the answer" during the break, which was what happened in this case.

His or her job is strictly to facilitate the process, to make sure that the participants' ideas, no matter how absurd or outrageous, are respected and championed. If the facilitator is busy generating, or worse yet championing, his or her own ideas, the delicate balance between mutual trust and personal risk quickly evaporates because the facilitator's ego has gotten in the way.Obviously, he's not getting the best out of his group. Unconsciously, he's promoting a feeling of competition rather than cooperation.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Or so the conventional wisdom goes.

Under certain circumstances I feel it's important and occasionally even critical, that the facilitator contribute ideas.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|When is it and when is it not a good idea for the facilitator to be contributing ideas?

If the facilitator is proposing ideas for his own self-aggrandizement, then no time is the right time! As the facilitator, he's not only not helping the group realize its full potential, he's actually getting in the way of the process. If, however, the facilitator has a different motivation for throwing out ideas-namely, for them to act as catalysts to spark the group into new and different ways of thinking-then by all means this is a good thing! Sometimes, for instance, especially when I've had the large group break up into smaller brainstorming subgroups, I will move from group to group proposing what I know are absurd, ridiculous, or even comical suggestions in an effort to encourage more risk taking in the participants' thinking.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|In the case of the manufacturing/marketing deadline problem, it was in discussing with my co-facilitator how to proceed with the session, that we hit upon "the answer."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|"Why not," we thought, "create a new kind of timeline/PERT chart that includes not only the deadlines for marketing decisions, but also the costs associated with _not_ making these decisions in time?" So, for example, in addition to the task deadline "final packaging design due by July 14," we'd also include the note: "If the packaging design decisions are not made by July 14, additional costs to the company will be approximately $10,000 for each week of delay."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|This "PERT/money chart" concept has three major advantages. First, it serves as an ongoing reminder to marketing of the cost of delaying decisions. Second, it makes each executive within marketing responsible, and therefore accountable, for the cost overruns that he or his department is causing. Finally, it gives manufacturing a way of charging back to marketing the increased costs incurred by marketing's indecisiveness. All in all, not a bad idea.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|So what did I do with this idea?

The last thing you as the facilitator want to do is try to take credit for ideas in a group session. Propose ideas, yes. Spark ideas, yes. But take credit, absolutely not! It's critical to the group energy and spirit that it be the creator of, and get credit for, _all_ the ideas in the session.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

Frequently, participants will say things like, "I'm not quite sure what I'm saying here," or, "I know it's kind of crazy, but there's something about that idea," or even, "This is probably a really stupid idea, but . ." It's very important for the facilitator to be sensitive to these kind of statements and encourage them at every opportunity. Why? Because they are indications that your group members are beginning to trust one another, and that they are using right-brain, creative, and holistic modes of thinking. The right brain deals primarily in pictures and feelings, and it shouldn't surprise the facilitator that group members will often stutter and stammer to find the left-brain words to express an idea that had its origins in a right-brain feeling or mental image.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|The facilitator's prompts can also help a participant develop an ill-formed, seemingly bad idea into one with great potential.

Without the facilitator's prompt, however, the idea could die before it ever has a chance at life.

Often a session will have such energy, and be proceeding so quickly, that if the facilitator is not careful, participants will be calling out ideas so quickly that he or she will miss a key idea or build. The prompts can help the facilitator slow down the flow of ideas, clarify what's being said, and give the time needed to accurately record the ideas on the flip chart.Prompts help the facilitator stay in control without being controlling.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Headlining\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|One of the most useful of the tricks of the brainstorming trade is for the facilitator to encourage the brainstormers to phrase their ideas in the form of a headline.

The best facilitators operate more by feel and intuition than by the need to adhere to a specific, predetermined schedule or plan outlining the day's creativity exercises. Above all, the facilitator needs to be sensitive to where the group wants to go. Sometimes the best thing a facilitator can do is just stay out of the way and let the group lead itself. Much like a jockey riding a prize thoroughbred, the facilitator has to let the group run when it\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

The facilitator has the responsibility for both being a part of this group identity and directing the group's unique energies and talents into the most productive channels of creative expression.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|There is a strange phenomenon that I have noticed from my years of facilitating a wide variety of groups and an eclectic assortment of creative assignments. In almost all the groups, I feel a certain sense of inevitability, or destiny if you will, of the ideas that ultimately emerge from the brainstorming session. It's as if the ideas were already there in the ether somehow, hovering just above the group, waiting for their time to be "discovered." Maybe it's because the best ideas are always simple and obvious, and invariably have that "why didn't I think of that before?" feeling to them.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|At some level, though, probably deep within the individual's (or the group's) subconscious mind(s), I believe that _they really did think of that idea before._ Like Michelangelo chipping away at a block of stone to "reveal the work of art already inside," I've come to see the facilitator's role as one of simply helping to reveal the ideas that have _already been created._\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Of course, occasionally you run into a group that you couldn't cut through with a sledge hammer (much less Michelangelo's hammer and chisel), but that's a different story. Deep down, way down, there's an idea waiting to get out; it just may not happen in our lifetime.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|A final word of advice to the would-be facilitator or group leader: Do not try to artificially manipulate a group's creative flow, either through mock cheerleading when things are not going well or by imposing a creative technique when the group is doing fine without one. You'll only tire yourself- and the group-out. Recognize that there are peaks and valleys in any creativity session. Sometimes the energy level will be high and the group excited; other times it will be low and the group seemingly out of gas. This is natural and to be expected. To get over the low-energy times, take more frequent breaks. Or have the group do something physical like jumping jacks or ceiling stretches for five or ten minutes. Or consider changing your physical environment (a good time is usually 2:30 or 3:00 in the afternoon, when the group's energy is traditionally at its lowest point), and go for an "idea walk."\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Saving the Worst for Last\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I wanted to give you one last brainstormer's trick of the trade.

(To add a little creative and competitive excitement to this exercise, consider giving a prize for the all-time _worst_ idea.) Stupid as this technique sounds, you'd be amazed how powerful a creative exercise it can be and how difficult it often is to think of a really bad idea. Invariably, someone will propose what initially, truth be told, does sound like a bad idea (often it's quite funny) but then, human nature (and the competitive spirit) being what it is, someone else will find a way to turn this really bad idea into something quite good, and occasionally brilliant.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|I think there are three reasons why this technique will work when all others fail. For one, it takes away all the performance pressure "to get that really great idea." People relax and say whatever comes to mind.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|Second, it's fun and funny, which, of course, is an essential ingredient in any successful session.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br><br>\|   \|   \|   \|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|---\|---\|---\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|And finally it employs the principle of opposites. As with yin and yang, hills and valleys, cold and warm, light and shadow, you can't have one without the other. So by looking for the worst idea, you often can't help but see the best idea, too. Take the campaign for the California raisins. When copywriters Seth Werner and Dextor Fedor were trying to brainstorm a campaign to promote California raisins, they were getting nowhere. Until, that is, they went over to a friend's house to work, and Werner happened to mockingly propose having the raisins "do something stupid like singing, 'Heard it through the Grapevine.' Everyone laughed and forgot about what was obviously a ridiculous idea until the next morning, when, upon reflection, absurd as it was, the idea seemed to have some merit. It wasn't long before Werner and partner Fedor had contacted Claymation creator Will Vinton, and one of advertising's most memorable and effective campaigns was born.\|<br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|   \|   \||

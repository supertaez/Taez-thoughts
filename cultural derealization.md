### Definition and Description

Cultural derealization refers to a subjective experience where a person perceives the external world as unreal, distant, distorted, or falsified [2]. It involves feeling disconnected from one's surroundings and perceiving them as lacking in spontaneity, emotional coloring, and depth [2].

Key aspects of derealization include:

- Feeling as if one is in a dream or "fog"
- Perceiving a "see-through wall" separating oneself from surroundings  
- Seeing objects/people as blurry, unnaturally sharp, too big/small, etc.
- Hearing distorted sounds (too loud/soft)
- Feeling like time is speeding up/slowing down
- Perceiving people around one as unreal or robotic [4]

### Causes and Risk Factors

While derealization can occur on its own, it often accompanies other conditions or experiences:

- Anxiety disorders, especially panic attacks
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- Childhood trauma/emotional abuse/neglect
- Drug/alcohol use (especially cannabis)
- Certain neurological conditions like epilepsy
- Severe stress or overwhelming situations [4]

Risk factors include personality traits that lead to avoidance of stressful situations, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse [4].

### Diagnosis and Treatment

There is no specific test for derealization. Diagnosis typically involves ruling out physical causes and referring to mental health professionals for assessment [4]. Treatment options include:

- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
- Psychodynamic therapy  
- Eye movement desensitization reprocessing (EMDR)
- Medication (if another condition is present) [4]

### Living With Derealization

Strategies for managing derealization episodes include:

- Grounding techniques (e.g. holding objects, touching ground)
- Breathing exercises
- Seeking support from loved ones or support groups
- Following treatment plans consistently
- Practicing self-care and stress reduction [4]

While derealization can be distressing, it's important to recognize that individuals experiencing it typically remain aware that something is off and how they feel isn't normal for them [4]. With proper treatment and support, many people see improvement in symptoms over time.
